## Australia


### <a href="http://lotsafreshair.com/">lotsafreshair.com</a>
Everyone talks about the need to unplug from their stressful lives and connect with nature and themselves by spending time in nature. However, when faced with the possibility of getting 'out there', many people come up with excuses that stop them from doing that. Lotsafreshair is a blog and YouTube channel all about encouraging people to get out and blow away those excuses. From what to pack, what food to take or how to adjust a backpack, Lotsafreshair aims to connect people with nature and help them fall in love with their outside selves. It provides a mix of not only practical quick tips and how-to's, but inspirational journeys and adventures in Australia and overseas.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/lotsafreshair"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a> <a href="http://twitter.com/Lotsafreshair"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>  <a href="http://instagram.com/Lotsafreshair"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Lotsafreshair"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a>

My name is Sabina Sirćo and I'm young blogger from Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I’m a passionate hiker and I enjoy traveling and writing about my adventures. For me hiking through dense forests, across mountains and untamed territory is like meditating. I love the feeling of freedom and adventure that comes from hiking and traveling.

### <a href="http://urbanpackrafter.com">urbanpackrafter.com</a>
My name is Jacob Kastrup Haagensen and I am a 34 year old Dane living in Copenhagen and working in the city administration. In the 2013 I brought a packraft and a year after I started documenting my trips by videos on the site <a href="http://www.urbanpackrafter.com">urbanpackrafter.com</a>. The idea was also to take micro adventures inside Copenhagen and other cities I visit. I want to inspire other packrafters also to use their packraft in the city. To see a city from the waterside gives you an hole new perspective on where you live. Educated in urban planning I have a love for cities and the opportunities they give. I also love the wild. Since my Boy Scout time I always being out in nature. I have a lot of love for the Scandinavian nature with its solitude and many of my wilderness trips goes to Sweden and Norway. A packraft gives other opportunities where lakes and rivers being trails instead of obstacles. <a href="https://twitter.com/urbanpackrafter"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>

Hey!  I'm Cesar and this is my blog.  I have been extremely interested in nature and the outdoors since I was a small child, and started going camping/backpacking on my own when I was around 16 years old.  I was born in 1980 in Los Angeles, CA, to a Mexican father and Nicaraguan mother, and since have lived and traveled all over the world.  I have been living in Sweden since 2006 with my best friend and wife and our children, two healthy, happy, amazing boys that are the light of my life.  Here are the goals of my blog in a nutshell:

1.  To create a website I wish I would have had access to when I started my journey as an outdoors enthusiast/backpacker/camper, long ago in the dark days before blogs existed.

2.  Document my continued development, experiences, trail guides, and what I have learned for myself and to share with others.

3.  Have an outlet to vent my nerdy backpacking obsessions and experiments, which are mostly centered around backpacking theory and gear.

I hope my blog is helpful and/or enjoyable to read.  Take care and happy trails to you.

Hi, my name is Tom Boughton. This blog follows my journey. In 2013 I was depressed and quit my office job in London, bought a bicycle and a tent and set off east with only a vague idea of where and why. Two years and 25,000 kilometers later I've cycled over the Alps, through minefields in the Balkans and across the empty quarter in Oman. Pushed the bike through snow drifts in Wales and up 20% inclines in Armenia. Visited Alexander the Great's birth place and the remains of Persepolis that he burnt down in Iran. Dodged army patrols in Musandam and fought off aggressive macaques in Malaysia. I reached the southern tip of New Zealand and didn't want to stop so I haven't yet. All the while I have been wild camping under the stars and living cheap.  Come along for the ride. <a href="https://twitter.com/gordon_comstock"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>

Welcome to my blog. I am a native Nevadan, traveler and outdoor explorer. I have lived in Spain, San Diego and New York, but Reno is my home. We are surrounded by the beautiful Sierra Mountains, which I have explored many times over. I have traveled and explored different beautiful mountain ranges, such as the 14er's in Colorado among many others, and plan to continue my exploration. My goal is to help you see the benefits of getting physical, and to encourage you to play. I hope my adventures will inspire you to get outside and feed your bliss, perhaps leading you to your next great idea! <a href="https://twitter.com/kelliehiking"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://instagram.com/kellieexploring"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a>

I’m a transplanted Southern Californian living in the Midwest. It’s taken some time, and plenty of searching, to appreciate the nature we have here. In the Midwest we don’t have the jagged peaks or deep canyons others do, but we do have trails to run and hike, rivers to canoe and kayak, and forests to explore. In winter we make do with ski hills, ride fat tire bikes, winter camping and snowshoeing to revisit favorite spots. Finding Adventure in my Backyard: trail running, hiking, camping, skiing, and pretty much want to try everything outdoors, at least once. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MidwestBasecamp"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a>  <a href="http://twitter.com/KovasP"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>  <a href="http://instagram.com/kovasp"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kovasp"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a>

SoCalHiker helps you find your next adventure. I started SoCalHiker back in 2010 as I was preparing for my second thru-hike on the epic John Muir Trail. I had to do the research on getting permits, training, and gear, and figured I'd share what I learned.

The result? Trail guides designed to give you all the details, including trailhead directions, difficulty, downloadable GPX data, maps and extensive photos. Basically, the kind of trail guides I was looking for.

Since 2010, SoCalHiker has grown to include detailed guides for trails throughout Southern California, as well as guides to epic backpacking treks like The Lost Coast, the Trans-Catalina Trail and of course, the John Muir Trail.
