Having parents from Iran and Austria travelling was always part of Patrick's life.

Patrick has also lived several months in Australia where he was diving with sharks and explored the blue mountains. Moreover, he has also worked in the Swiss mountains for several months which was a perfect place for snowboarding and skiing adventures in powder snow.
