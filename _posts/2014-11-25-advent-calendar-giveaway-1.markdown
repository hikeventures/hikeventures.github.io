Ho Ho Ho - Here comes our first giveaway - an [aquapac](http://store.aquapac.net/splash/index.html) waterproof camera pouch! This is a great camera bag which I use myself for my Sony A7r + Sony 35mm 2.8 lens. <br><br>

On the bottom of the bag there is sufficient space to store another spare battery, remote control and SD cards. The camera pouch has a waterproof level of [IPX6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) <br><br>
