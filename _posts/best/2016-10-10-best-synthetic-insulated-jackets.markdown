Sometimes you might also get a down jacket for a significant lower price especially at the end of the season when stores want to clear their stock. In many cases the new models just come with a different color so it's worth to have a look on the old models as well.

The Arcteryx Cerium LT Hoody is not a pure synthetic insulated jacket and replaces the synthetic insulation with 850 goose down on areas where moisture may build up. With 295 grams it's the lightest jacket in our list. This jacket is useful for active people but you may rather pick a different jacket if you are planning to visit a very wet or humid place.
