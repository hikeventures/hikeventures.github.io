In this post we have selected the best places for us to go hiking and packrafting in 2017 - 2018. We will probably add a few more trips through the year.

# Austria
Vorarlberg will be on our list in 2017. Having lived there for 2 years in the past I am looking forward to visit the Montafon or Silvretta area for a hike next summer. Last winter we have visited Vorarlberg during the winter where we did some [snowshoeing](http://www.hikeventures.com/Testing-MSR-Revo-Ascent-Light-Deploy-T2-Flight-2-Austrian-Alps/).

# Norway
In January we are planning to visit Norway for a winter camping adventure. Equipped with our snowshoes and a Titanium stove we will explore the area around Alta. One highlight will be to visit an observation point on a mountain where we will be able to observe the Northern Lights. There is also a Canyon nearby Alta where we are planning to snowshoe and camp. I already enjoyed Norway last summer when I travelled to the [Varangerfjord](http://www.hikeventures.com/Finnmark/).

# Scotland
In may we will probably join a packrafting round-up in Scotland. Here is also a [link](https://www.facebook.com/events/140680829718198/) where you can sign up for it. Last spring we went [packrafting on the River Dee](http://www.hikeventures.com/Packrafting-River-Dee-Scotland-1/) on the River Dee and quite enjoyed it.

# Sweden
End of April we will join the Swedish Packrafting round-up. Here is a link about this event on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/445731775597846/). The event will be on a river nearby the Fulufj√§llet National Park and is a six hours drive from Stockholm. Here you can also read about the last [packrafting round-up](http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/) in Sweden.

In August there is also going to be a 7 days [hike](https://www.facebook.com/events/857479497686986/) on the Kungsleden which we might join.

I will keep this list updated once we have more details about additional hiking and packrafting trips for 2017.
