Today I would like to present you the best outdoor GPS watches with color display for hiking and backpacking which you can wear on your next hiking or backpacking trip, for running or on any other outdoor activity. At the moment I am wearing a [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) which has a monochrome display. I am quite satisfied with my [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) so far but I would be interested to get an outdoor watch which features a color display.

We have been hiking, packrafting and snowshoeing in Scandinavia, Russia and Continental Europe (read our [trip reports](http://www.hikeventures.com/destinations/)) and we always [keep an eye on the market](http://www.hikeventures.com/ISPO-2016-interviews/) for better products which we could possibly take on our trips in the future. The links on this site contain affiliate links and the GPS watches below would be our choice if we were to buy a new GPS watch.

Probably one disadvantage of watches having a colour display and a GPS was their short battery life in the past. The <a href="http://amzn.to/1YdNH1H" rel="nofollow">Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10</a> advertises it's watch with 3 days in monochrome mode however the WDS-F10 does not have a GPS built in. My Traverse lasts approximately 1 day if I switch the GPS on depending on the tracking frequency and GPS accuracy. The watches in my list are sorted by their weight.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/2dysTQc" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Series 2 Sport 42mm</a>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LW9G4UO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01LW9G4UO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=1d879893fd442284bffcaecbf986807d"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01LW9G4UO&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01LW9G4UO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 34.2 grams  
**Battery Life:** 18 hours (not in training mode)
**Operating System:** watchOS 3  
**Water Resistance:** Water resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010
**Display:** 312x319   
**Touchscreen:** Force Touch   
**Wi-Fi:** yes   
**Bluetooth:** 4.0   
**Heart Rate Monitor:** wrist-based   
**GPS:** yes
**Wireless charging:** yes   

The Apple watch SERIES 2 42mm is for those folks who like to have their iPhone with them. The new Apple Watch Series 2 also features a built-in GPS and is an excellent choice if you exercise 1-2 hours a day. However, if you are more into multisport or longer cycling or hiking trips I would rather buy the new Suunto Spartan which can be used much longer in training mode than the Apple Watch Series 2. Both watches - the Suunto Spartan and the Apple Watch Series 2 are suitable for swimmers. However, the Apple Watch Series 2 should not be used for diving.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/1t7QAFm" rel="nofollow">Motorola Moto 360 Sport</a>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016CKHAZO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B016CKHAZO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4c6098a87f5b1865e89b5e207acc1007"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B016CKHAZO&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B016CKHAZO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 54 grams  
**Battery Life:** 1 day  
**Operating System:** Android Wear™  
**Water Resistance:** IP67 - not   waterproof   
**Display:** 360x325   
**Touchscreen:** no   
**Wi-Fi:** yes   
**Bluetooth:** 4.0   
**Heart Rate Monitor:** Optical heart rate monitor (PPG)   
**GPS:** yes   
**Wireless charging:** yes   

Another interesting Outdoor watch is the Motorola Moto 360 Sport which is targeted towards Android users as it has the AndroidWear™ operating system on board. It also features an optical hear rate monitor directly on the watch which can only be found on the Apple watch so far. No need to wear a hear rate monitor around your chest. One highlight of the Moto 360 Sport is probably it's high resolution / display.

## [Garmin Fenix 3](http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-fenix-3-bundle)

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A5HIQ7Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01A5HIQ7Q&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=3361c3ff4f51ddbeb0f8fd1c9f2e25aa"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01A5HIQ7Q&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01A5HIQ7Q" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Garmin Fenix 3 can be connected to Android and Apple phones and was one of the first proper sport watches which featured a graphic display and is going to be challenged by the new [Suunto Spartan](https://www.rei.com/product/107290/suunto-spartan-ultra-gps-multifunction-watch).

## <a href="http://amzn.to/1YdNH1H" rel="nofollow">Casio WSD-F10</a>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CY1QXR6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01CY1QXR6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=e259bc0b895c4a2b5cc6dec4c027ab7f"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01CY1QXR6&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01CY1QXR6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 93 grams   
**Battery Life:** 1 day (only color LCD), 3.5 days (only monochrome LCD)   
**Operating System:** Android Wear™   
**Water Resistance:** 50 meters   
**Display:** 320x300 pixels   
**Touchscreen:** yes   
**Wi-Fi:** yes   
**Bluetooth:** 4.1   
**Heart Rate Monitor:**   
**GPS:** via Smartphone   
**Wireless charging:** no   


The Casio WSD-F10 is the latest smart watch from Casio. It's one of the few watches which have AndroidWear installed as an operating system. If I would have an Android phone then this watch could be an interesting choice if would not need a built in GPS in my watch.

Apple users should probably look at an alternative watch as the the Casio WSD-F10 can only be connected to Android phones.

In general, I found that the Casio WSD-F10 looks quite nice. I like the displays and AndroidWear as an OS should probably offer nice upgrade functionalities in the future. The only disadvantage I see with this watch is that I basically need to carry my smartphone with me as the watch does not have a built-in GPS. For me as a runner and hiker I would prefer a watch with a dedicated GPS module on board.

## [Suunto Spartan Ultra](https://www.rei.com/product/107290/suunto-spartan-ultra-gps-multifunction-watch)

The Suunto Spartan is the latest smart watch addition in the Suunto range. Unfortunately, there are no specifications about the Suunto Spartan available yet beside that it's going to be the first Suunto watch which features a colour display. As Suunto watches can be connected to Moveslink - the Suunto Online Sport Community - it is possible to use the Suunto Spartan either with your Android phone or with your iPhone.

## Conclusion
From the currently released outdoor watches with color display I would probably pick the [Suunto Spartan Ultra](https://www.rei.com/product/107290/suunto-spartan-ultra-gps-multifunction-watch). As a current [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) user I have already my GPS data stored in [Movescount](http://www.movescount.com/members/member140205-HikeVentures) so switching brands is anyway not an easy option for me.

If I would not need the longer training mode (GPS) of the Suunto Spartan then I would probably buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dysTQc" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Series 2 Sport</a> as I have an iPhone. I would also pick the 42 mm Apple Sport version as I prefer a bigger screen.
