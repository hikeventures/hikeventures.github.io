In this blog post I would like to present you with my selection of the best wallets for your next hiking or backpacking trip.   

As with your hiking clothes a wallet should be easy to clean, water resistant or dry fast.

Alternatively, you can also store your wallet in a plastic bag to keep it dry.   

Further, you might also want to look into a wallet which does not take too much space and is lightweight.

## Fjällräven Zip Wallet

Both wallets are made of G-1000 fabric - a synthetic / cotton mixture which Fjällräven also uses on it's clothes and can hold credit cards and coins.  

The fabric can be treated with wax to waterproof it.

## Conclusion

The most affordable solution is probably to use a cheap plastic bag and wrap it around your wallet.

Personally, I use both - a Fjällräven Zip Card Holder and sometimes an additional plastic bag when I go packrafting.

The Chums wallet would be quite useful if you are into watersports such as kayaking or pack rafting.
