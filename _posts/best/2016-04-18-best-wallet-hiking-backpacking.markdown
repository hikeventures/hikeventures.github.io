When you are new into hiking and backpacking then you might come up with the question where to store your money and credit cards while on the trail? Here is a short article about my personal wallet choice when I go outdoors (this blog post contains affiliate links).

Sometimes - especially when you are new into hiking and backacking - you don't really think that much about your wallet. However, when you get  more experience and plan to cut some weight on your gear then you will realize that even changing your wallet can make a difference in weight and functionality.

But not only weight is an important factor when considering which wallet to choose. In some countries there is no need to have cash with you e.g. in Finland you can pay in most places with a card. Maybe there are some exceptions where you still need some cash with you but in most places you will be fine with a card. In countries where you can pay mostly with cards you can even take a smaller wallet with you like the Fjällräven Zip Card Holder.

However, if you still prefer to have notes and coins with you then there is also the Fjällräven Zip Wallet which is a  bit bigger than the Fjällräven Zip Card Holder and has more compartments to store your cards and money.

Both wallets are made of G-1000 fabric - a synthetic / cotton mixture which Fjällräven also uses on it's clothes.

## Alternatives
If you are on a budget then there is no need to spend a lot of money on expensive wallets. An inexpensive alternative to the wallets which I have mentioned above is a simple plastic bag where you can store your money while on the trail. This is probably an even safer option to keep your notes and cards dry.

##  Conclusion
If functionality is the main criteria for choosing your wallet for your next hiking or backpacking trip then you should probably go for a cheap plastic bag. If you also want a fashionable wallet which you can use as a regular wallet in the city then I would recommend one of the Fjällräven wallets. To make them 100% waterproof you might however still place it in some sort of plastic bag or at least wax the G-1000 fabric. Personally, I use both - a Fjällräven Zip Card Holder and a plastic bag when I go packrafting.
