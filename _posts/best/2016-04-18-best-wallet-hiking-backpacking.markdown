In this blog post I would like to present you with my selection of the best wallets for your next hiking or backpacking trip.
</p>
<p>
As with hiking clothes a wallet should be easy to clean, water resistant or dry fast.

Alternatively, you can also store your wallet in a plastic bag to keep it dry.

Further, you might also want to look into a wallet which does not take too much space and is lightweight.

## Fjällräven Zip Wallet

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0HYV32/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00I0HYV32&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=09d68924674b068d590430a7fdfdc4da"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00I0HYV32&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00I0HYV32" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Both wallets are made of G-1000 fabric - a synthetic / cotton mixture which Fjällräven also uses on it’s clothes and can hold credit cards and coins.

The fabric can be treated with wax to waterproof it.

## Conclusion

The most affordable solution is probably to use a cheap plastic bag and wrap it around your wallet.

Personally, I use both - a Fjällräven Zip Card Holder and sometimes an additional plastic bag when I go packrafting.

The Chums wallet would be quite useful if you are doing watersport such as kayaking or pack rafting.
