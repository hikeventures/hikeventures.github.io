In this blog post I would like to present you my selection of the best light hiking shoes for 2017.

I was wearing light hiking shoes on my [hiking trip](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/) in the Sarek National Park in Sweden. Compared to traditional hiking boots they are much lighter and packable.

## Advantages of ultralight hiking shoes

* They are very lightweight compared to traditional hiking or backpacking boots.
* They don’t need that much space to store them.
* They dry faster.
* Sometimes they costs are lower.

<hr>

## Disadvantages of ultralight hiking shoes

* There is a chance that you will get wet feet since those shoes don’t go over your ankles especially if you don’t buy a GTX (waterproof) shoe. One solution to keep your feet dry would be to wear latex socks over your regular merino socks.
* Ultralight Hiking Shoes won’t give you much support when carry a heavier backpack.
* Durability can be an issue if your shoe is made of very thin and lightweight materials.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right ultralight hiking shoes is not just a matter of specs and features but also about the design.

The Inov-8 Roclite 282 GTX are probably the best shoes which you can get if you look for the lightest weight and a good sole.

At least I was happy with my Inov-8 shoes when I was hiking 1 week in Sweden beside having constantly we feet.

However, in some cases you can also dry them in the evenings on a camp fire (if it’s allowed in the area where you are planning to go hiking).

The most important factors for me are weight, grip of the sole and if they can dry fast.
