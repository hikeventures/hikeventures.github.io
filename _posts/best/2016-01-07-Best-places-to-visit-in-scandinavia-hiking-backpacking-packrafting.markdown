### Sarek National Park in Sweden
The Sarek National Park is one of the remotest areas in Sweden to visit. You can travel by train from Stockholm to Gällivare and then take a bus towards Suorva.

Unfortunately, it is not allowed to packraft anymore in the Sarek National Park but it’s still one of the best places to visit if you are planning an extended outdoor adventure with a breathtaking scenery.

Since there is no phone signal available you should consider taking some sort of GPS messenger with you especially if you travel alone. [Here](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/) you can read more about our adventure in the Swedish mountains.

### Torneträsk lake (Abisko National Park) in Sweden
The Torneträsk lake located next to the Abisko National Park is a bit further north than the Sarek National Park. However, it is easier to access the National Park compared to the Sarek National Park as you don’t have to change from the train to a bus.

From the Torneträsk lake you can enjoy a great view towards the Lapporten (the Lapponian Gate). There are also skiing possibilities and the [Aurora Sky Station](http://www.auroraskystation.com/en/) where you have a chance to observe northern lights.

In our case we found a local person who drove us about 30 km west towards Norway from the SFT Abisko Turiststation where we inflated our packrafts and jumped into the river where we paddled over 3 days. Just make sure to get out of the river at certain places and carry your packraft as there are some very dangerous rapids around.

Further, you should also have some sort of outdoor experience (e.g. how to read a map etc.) as there was no touristic infrastructure on our route. If you are more into hiking than packrafting then you should also give the Kungsleden a try. There is also an organised hiking event every summer called Fjällräven Classic where we also participated. More about this trip [here](http://www.hikeventures.com/packrafting-Njuoreatnu-Tornetrask-abisko/).

### Aland Islands in Finland
The Aland Islands in Finland are great if you like the sea and if you don’t want to walk up many hills. There are around 6700 islands which you can visit. Aland is also a popular destination if you plan to bicycle there (e.g. bikepacking). Some ferries can be used free of charge. There is also the Kastelholm Castle which you can visit when you arrive in Mariehamn (25 km to travel) by ferry ([Viking](https://www.vikingline.fi/) or [Silja Line](http://www.tallinksilja.fi/fi/etsi-matka)). In our case we traveled with our car (and 2 ferry trips) to Kökar and explored the island. More about this trip [here](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-on-the-aland-islands/).

### Alta River (Altaelva) in Norway
If you are planning to visit Alta in Norway then make sure to take your packraft with you. The scenery is quite breathtaking and also worth for a shorter trip. The Alta River has a length of 240 km and has carved out the  Sautso, one of the largest canyons in Europe. [Here](http://www.hikeventures.com/Packrafting-Alta-River/) is our story about packrafting the Alta River.

### Urho Kekkonen National Park in Finland
We have visited the Urho Kekkonen National Park in Finland for a winter adventure. We were flying to Ivalo and then took the bus to Kiilopää where we stayed in the [Suomen Latu](http://www.suomenlatu.fi/) (a Finnish Outdoor Club) hostel which was reasonably priced. We experienced sauna, ice swimming, cross-country skiing, fell sledging and snowshoeing. [Here](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/) more about our lapland adventure.

Those were the best places we have visited so far in Scandinavia. We will probably add a few more destinations for hiking, backpacking, kayaking or packrafting in the future as we are planning more outdoor trips in Scandinavia.
