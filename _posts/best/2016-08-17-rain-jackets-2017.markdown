Here is a <a href="#table">selection</a> of the new rain jackets for 2018 on the market. This is not a complete list and I may add a few more models in the future.

I always take a rain jacket with me when I go [hiking](http://www.hikeventures.com/destinations/), backpacking or cycling.

Depending on the season or activity it might also be a good idea to have different rain jackets.

For example, I would take a very light rain jacket if I am planning to go on a hiking or backpacking trip.

For winter activities - like skiing or snowboarding - I would rather take a more durable jacket with me.
