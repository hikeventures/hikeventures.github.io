<h2 style="color:red">Our selection of the best lightweight wind jackets 2017 for ultralight outdoor adventures.</h2>
<br>

Do you wear a fleece on your hike but still feel cold. Well, it's probably because your fleece jacket does not protect you against cold winds. A lightweight wind jacket is probably one of the most useful piece of clothes which you can take when going hiking, backpacking, climbing, cycling, running or plan any other backcountry trip. A wind jacket does not need much space so you can easily store it in your backpack. Just make sure that you buy a wind jacket with a hoodie. Have a look on my <a href="#list">wind jacket comparison table</a>.

## Should your hiking jacket be waterproof or only windproof?
A wind jacket is much lighter and you won't sweat that much in it compared to a [rain jacket][4]. My own preference goes towards carrying both - a wind jacket AND a rain jacket - and to wear them according to the current weather situation. If it's raining, I am obviously going to wear a rain jacket but if it's dry and there is only a cold wind blowing then I quickly pull on a wind jacket over my [fleece][5].In the evenings while sitting in the camp I swap my [fleece][6] and wind jacket combo with a [down jacket][7].

The Arcteryx Incendo Hoody has breathable mesh panels under the arms, a hood and a full front zip. It also features an internal MP3 pocket with audio ports, a side stow pocket and reflective blazes. The Incendo Hoody is more a running jacket than a hiking jacket but could be an alternative to the Arcteryx Squamish Hoody if you are an Arcteryx fan and want to save a few grams.

# Conclusion
There is probably not much difference between the wind breakers in my buying guide about the best wind jackets and it's more about your own preference towards color and brand. I am wearing the [Arcteryx Squamish Hoody][12] since years and I am quite happy with it. Konstantin just recently got a [Patagonia Houdini][13] and is also very pleased with it.
