Here is my [selection](#weight-comparison-table) of the best wind jackets for 2017 - 2018 which I would consider to take on my next hiking or backpacking trip.

A lightweight wind jacket is probably one of the most useful pieces of clothes which you can take with you. It does not need much space, and you can easily store it in your backpack.

I always combine a wind jacket with a [fleece jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-windjackets/) to protect myself against cold winds.

Also, have a look at our [FAQ on wind-jackets](#faq-on-wind-jackets).

### Are wind jackets waterproof?
No, wind jackets are not waterproof. Their purpose is to protect against cold winds and compared to [rain jackets](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-rain-jackets/) they are very breathable, and you won't sweat that much in it either.

### Should a wind jacket have a hoodie?
I would recommend buying a wind jacket with a hood. You lose most of your body temperature on your head. You will feel warmer if you protect your head against cold winds.

### Should I carry a wind- and a rain jacket?
Depending on the weather forecast I would wear a wind jacket if it's not raining and exchange it with a [rain jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-rain-jackets/) if the weather turns bad. I wear rain clothes only when it is raining.

### What are wind jackets made of?
Wind jackets are made of very light fabric, e.g., 15 or 20 denier nylon. They are not that durable as rain jackets, but they are excellent to wear in warm temperatures.

## My own gear

There is probably not much difference between the wind breakers in my buying guide about the best wind jackets and it’s more about your own preference towards color and brand.

I am wearing the Arc’teryx Squamish Hoody since years and I am quite happy with it. Konstantin just recently got a Patagonia Houdini and is also very pleased with it.
