Do you wear a fleece on your hike but still feel cold. Well, it's probably because your fleece jacket does not protect you against cold winds. A lightweight wind jacket is probably one of the most useful piece of clothes which you can take when going hiking, backpacking, climbing, cycling, running or plan any other backcountry trip. A wind jacket does not need much space so you can easily store it in your backpack. Just make sure that you buy a wind jacket with a hoodie.

We have been hiking, packrafting and snowshoeing in Scandinavia, Russia and Continental Europe (read our [trip reports][1]) and even so we are not able to test every product, we follow the market and compare the specifications of new products. Here comes our buying guide (this blog post contains affiliate links).

# Should your hiking jacket be waterproof or only windproof?
A wind jacket is much lighter and you won't sweat that much in it compared to a [rain jacket][4]. My own preference goes towards carrying both - a wind jacket AND a rain jacket - and to wear them according to the current weather situation. If it's raining, I am obviously going to wear a rain jacket but if it's dry and there is only a cold wind blowing then I quickly pull on a wind jacket over my [fleece][5].In the evenings while sitting in the camp I swap my [fleece][6] and wind jacket combo with a [down jacket][7].

# Conclusion
There is probably not much difference between the wind breakers in my buying guide about the best wind jackets and it's more about your own preference towards color and brand. I am wearing the [Arcteryx Squamish Hoody][12] since years and I am quite happy with it. Konstantin just recently got a [Patagonia Houdini][13] and is also very pleased with it.
