In this blog post you can find a selection of the best new sleeping pads for 2017. There are different sleeping pads for different seasons or climates available. The R-value indicates how much insulation a sleeping pad provides. In the conclusion you can find the sleeping pad which I would recommend.

We have been hiking, packrafting and snowshoeing in Scandinavia, Russia and Continental Europe (read our [trip reports](http://www.hikeventures.com/destinations/)) and even so we were not able to test every product in this blog post, we follow the market and compare the specifications of new sleeping pads. Here comes our sleeping pads buying guide for 2016 (this blog post contains affiliate links).

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Personally, I like the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/deals/#neoair-xtherm" target="_blank">Therm-a-Rest XTherm</a> the most and I use it during summer and winter time. Even so it is not the newest sleeping pad on the market, it provides high insulation and comes with low weight. I always carry it on our <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/destinations/" target="_blank">hiking and packrafting trips</a>.
