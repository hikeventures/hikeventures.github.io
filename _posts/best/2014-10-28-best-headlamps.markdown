Here is my <a href="#table">selection</a> of the best lightweight headlamps for 2017 - 2018 which I would consider taking to my next hiking, backpacking or camping trip.
</p>
<p>
Having a headlamp can be a life saver, and itâ€™s a good idea to have one with you in your backpack especially during the winter.

The Petzl NAO+, for example, has plenty of features and you can also connect the Petzl NAO Belt Kit to carry the battery under the jacket which is especially useful to prevent battery drain in [colder regions](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/) or during the winter. I have also used the previous model of the Petzl NAO in  [Swedish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/).

However, if you are looking for a smaller headlamp which is also waterproof, then I would rather pick the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=150351&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890322%2Fblack-diamond-spot-headlamp-2016" rel="nofollow">Black Diamond Spot</a> which features red light and 200 Lumen - sufficient for hiking even in the Alps.

Also, have a look at our [FAQ on headlamps](#faq-on-headlamps).

## Black Diamond Icon

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FNCPBE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005FNCPBE&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=WBUHJA3GU3TCBJXQ" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B005FNCPBE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005FNCPBE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="Black Diamond Icon" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight**: 8.1 oz. / 230 grams<br>
**Lumen**: 500<br>
**Watertightness**: IP X7 (watertight)<br>
**Max Beam Distance**: 110 meters

With 220 grams and 'only' 500 Lumen, the Black Diamond Icon has a pretty good Lumen/Weight ratio.

If you are planning to go kayaking or packrafting, then you should probably take a watertight headlamp like the Black Diamond Icon with you.

However, with its external battery, it needs probably more room in your backpack, and you will also carry more weight on your head.

## Black Diamond Spot

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0106PER0C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0106PER0C&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=cd7067e8762594645a047e9fea28e1ba"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B0106PER0C&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0106PER0C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

## Petzl e+LITE

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AUBOTS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008AUBOTS&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=V5A2XQXJ3LK3X3NP" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B008AUBOTS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B008AUBOTS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="Petzl e+LITE" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight**:  0.95 oz. / 27 grams<br>
**Lumen**: 26<br>
**Watertightness**: IP X7 (watertight)<br>

The Petzl e+LITE is the emergency headlamp from Petzl.

It could be the right choice for ultralight enthusiasts who can manage with less light.

If you want to see more into the distance, then this is probably not the headlamp you should consider to buy.

## Petzl NAO+

<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GFPMEXY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01GFPMEXY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=7692c42c112d14f3972fcff2c3a6f9a8"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01GFPMEXY&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01GFPMEXY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight**: 6.5 oz. /185 grams<br>
**Lumen**: 750<br>
**Watertightness**: IP X4 (water resistant)<br>
**Max Beam Distance**: 140 meters

The Petzl NAO+ features 750 lumens. Its reactive lightning system lets you also adjust the light level automatically without turning or pushing any buttons on the headlamp.

With reactive lightning, you will have a burn time of 6 hours and 30 minutes you can charge the battery of the Petzl NAO within 5 hours.

Usually, I also take an additional battery with me such as the <a href="http://amzn.to/2sFvmzn" rel="nofollow">Anker PowerCore 2000</a> to charge my headlamp and other USB devices during my trips. You can also adjust the straps on the sides and on the top.

I also have the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=150351&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F109576%2Fpetzl-nao-headlamp-belt-kit" rel="nofollow">Petzl NAO Belt Kit</a>, which allows me to carry the battery in my backpack or on my belt rather than on my head. It feels much better to carry less weight on the head but also prevents battery drain if the temperatures are low.

With the OS by Petzl, you are also able to adjust the light levels on your PC and Mac.

The Petzl NAO is my preferred headlamp. If you are looking for a lighter headlamp which can also be charged by USB, then have a look at the Black Diamond Spot.

You can also get an additional <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=150351&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F109575%2Fpetzl-nao-rechargeable-headlamp-battery" rel="nofollow">rechargeable battery</a> for the NAO+.

The Reactik+ also has a lock function, so it won't accidentally turn on during travel. The 1800 mAh battery is also rechargeable through the USB port. Moreover, there is also a red lightning mode.

**Lumen**: 180<br>

The Tikka XP features spot and flood beams. There is also the red LEDs which you can use during the night for less eye fatigue and the one-touch boost to quickly access the maximum brightness.

The Petzl Tikka XP also activates itâ€™s reserve mode once batteries are running low. You can either use 3 AAA NiMH or lithium batteries.

### What is the red light on a headlamp?
Red light keeps your eyes adjusted to the dark. You can also find red lights for example in submarines. Red light is great to use in the tent for example if you want to read a book.

Red light won't fatigue your eyes that much than regular white light. It's also won't disturb others when you are on a camping site.

---

### What is the green light on a headlamp?
Nocturnal animals might notice green light less during the night. For example, it might attract fewer bugs when you hang around in camp.

The green light is also less harsh on your eyes than red or white. However, you may lose some color information.

---

### Rechargeable Lithium-ion or alkalines batteries
New headlamp models also offer you the possibility to recharge their lithium-ion batteries through its USB socket.

The difference between alkalines and lithium-ion is that you can operate the headlamp with fully charged alkalines longer than with a fully charged lithium-ion headlamp.
