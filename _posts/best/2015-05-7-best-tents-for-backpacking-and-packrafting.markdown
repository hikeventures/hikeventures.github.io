For our packrafting kayaking trips we are currently using the [Hilleberg Anjan](http://www.hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/ "Hilleberg Anjan") which has served us quite well so far in [Sweden](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Packrafting in Sarek"), [the Netherlands](http://www.hikeventures.com/packrafting-in-the-weerribben-wieden-national-park/ "Packrafting in the Netherlands") and [Finland](http://www.hikeventures.com/halloween-adventure-at-lake-suolijarvi/ "Packrafting in Finland"). We have <a href="#list">selected</a> our favorite freestanding and non-freestanding tents  for 2016 - 2017 in this blog post as well as normal and ultralight tents.

## The best freestanding and self-supporting tents

### [Marmot Force UL 2P](http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-force-ul-2p-tent-2-person-3-season)

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M85RDHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00M85RDHS&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=5f772e039fab5f9894178931a800150c" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00M85RDHS&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00M85RDHS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Marmot Force UL 2P is a freestanding 2-person tent for 3 seasons.

**Persons:** 2   
**Fabric:** 15D ripstop / 20D ripstop (floor)   
**Weight:** 1.3 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²   

The Marmot Force UL 2P is a new freestanding tent which comes in a super light package. The Marmot Force UL 2P also uses a very thin tent fabric so you should also handle it carefully. I would also get a [tent footprint](http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-force-ul-2p-footprint) with this tent. I will use the Marmot Force UL 2P this year in Scandinavia as a 1 person tent. I have used the Marmot Force UL 2P on my trips in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/) and [Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/Finnmark/). Marmot provided us the tent for testing.

### [MSR Hubba Hubba NX](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_MSR-Hubba-Hubba-NX-2-Person-Tent_10238367_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G7H9CAY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00G7H9CAY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=EX4S5YFHURHMA3L5"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7H9CAY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00G7H9CAY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is a freestanding 2-person tent for 3 seasons.

**Persons:** 2   
**Fabric:** 20D ripstop / 30D ripstop (floor)   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.7 m²   

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is a great 3 season tent and it even costs almost half the price of a Hilleberg tent. The Hilleberg just has a stronger floor material (50D) compared to the MSR but you get plenty of room. I think it's a tough decision to choose between the Niak 1.5 and the Hubba Hubba NX. If you are low on budget then we could highly recommend the Hubba Hubba NX as we have also used it on our trip in Sweden and Japan. A review will soon be available on our blog.

### [Hilleberg Niak 1.5](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Niak-1-5-Person-Tent_10306870_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT52A08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01AT52A08&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=2TDIHYJWJ46ET5ID" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01AT52A08&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B01AT52A08" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Persons:** 1-2    
**Fabric:** Kerlon 600   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²   

The Enan as a solo tent looks like an interesting tent for the summer months. However, if you need more space e.g. if there is a longer rain period then you would appreciate most likely the new Niak 1.5. It can accommodate 1-2 persons and has a vestibule to store your gear. I was actually interested in getting the Hilleberg Soulo or the Akto as a go-to solo tent but I would prefer having the Niak 1.5 if I would just use it during the warmer months.

### [Hilleberg Soulo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Soulo-1-Person-Tent_10101479_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LAP3G6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LAP3G6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=7TXJU4WYWUN5PLN3"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004LAP3G6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004LAP3G6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Persons:** 1   
**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200   
**Weight:** 2.4 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.0 m²  

The Hilleberg Soulo is a very strong solo expedition tent. If strength is important to you and you need a dedicated vestibule then you should choose the Soulo rather than the Unna.

# The best non-freestanding and tunnel tents

### [Fly Creek HV UL1](https://www.rei.com/product/895953/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul1-tent)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSYH1T0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GSYH1T0&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=UQ5VQ5S2FSWYOS4K" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSYH1T0&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00GSYH1T0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Persons:** 1   
**Length:** 218 cm  
**Width:** 71 cm (95cm)   
**Height:** 97 cm  
**Inner Space:** 1.8 m²  
**Vestibule:** 0.45 m²  
**Weight:** 935 grams   

The Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL1 is the lightest tent in this list. It is a bit taller and longer than the Hilleberg Enan but has a smaller vestibule. Fly and floor have 1200mm waterproof polyurethane coating.

### [Hilleberg Enan](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Enan-1-Person-Tent_10274355_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UZ8ZPIE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UZ8ZPIE&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=J5D2VAGZEEOJ4END"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZ8ZPIE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UZ8ZPIE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Persons:** 1   
**Fabric:** Kerlon 600   
**Weight:** 1.1 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 1.7 m²  

If you are travelling alone on a shorter trip where you don't have lot's of gear with you then the Hilleberg Enan with 1100 grams could be a light choice during the warmer months. The only disadvantage we see with this tent is that it's not very roomy. It's also shorter then the Akto and you can only sit in one position in this tent. Venting should be quite good if you position one end of the tent with the mesh towards the wind.

### [Hilleberg Akto](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Akto-1-Person-Tent_10101417_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKHF7E8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TKHF7E8&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=VP7IBWWKQQ3PVKWT"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKHF7E8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00TKHF7E8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />


**Persons:** 1   
**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²   

The Akto is a solo tent with low weight and quite popular among solo travellers. If you are not going into extreme conditions then this could be a great solo tent if you don't need a lot of space. For harsher conditions I would rather pick the Hilleberg Soulo which comes with more space.

### [Hilleberg Nallo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Nallo-3-Person-Tent_10101458_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMR6HSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMR6HSO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4YIQPTOP7VXOY4EM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMR6HSO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMR6HSO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Persons:** 1-2   
**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 130 cm   
**Height:** 100 cm   
**Area inner tent:** 2.8 m²   
**Vestibule:** 1.3 m²  
**Weight:** 2400 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200  

The Hilleberg Nallo is probably the best choice if you want a 4-season tent which offers the most space and a vestibule for the least weight. If you don't need a freestanding tent and the best weight / space ratio 4-season tent then you should pick the Nallo.

### [Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/ultamid-2.html)

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26835366172/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Tent &amp; Ultamid Tarp"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/26835366172_4b9630972f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="723" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Tent &amp; Ultamid Tarp"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**Persons:** 1-2   
**Length:** 271.8 cm   
**Width:** 210.8 cm   
**Height:** 162.6 cm   
**Weight:** 499 grams    
**Fabric:** Dyneema® (Cuben Fiber)

The Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2 is an ultralight tent designed if you want to camp in unexposed environments. On the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/">packrafting round-up in Sweden</a> I had the chance to see the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2 and were quite impressed.

## How to choose a tent?

### Do I need a tent footprint when I go camping?
I consider a tent footprint as unnecessary weight if you go hiking but it might be useful if you want to limit floor condensation. However, on ultralight tents like the MSR Hubba Hubba NX I would definitely use a tent footprint.

### Tent pegs & poles
Tents usually come with pegs. If you want to save a little bit of weight then you could also purchase separate carbon pegs and poles like the [MSR Carbon Core Stake Kit](http://amzn.to/1Q32GJG "MSR Carbon Core") which weights only 6 grams.

### Should I choose a tunnel tent or dome tent?
Another consideration might be if you need a freestanding dome tent or a tunnel tent. A tunnel tent might be lighter but a freestanding tent can be pitched on more difficult ground like a rock or on a sand beach. There are also self-supporting tents which are more or less freestanding but still need 2 or more stakes. Currently, I am having a tunnel tent - the Hilleberg Anjan 3 - and I am quite happy with it but I am thinking to exchange it with a Nallo 3 and a mesh inner Tent.

### Can I use a tent as a Tarp?
Do you want to leave your inner tent at home to save some weight and use the outer tent as a tarp?

### Should I use a mesh as an inner tent?
In the warmer months you would like to have a mesh as an inner tent either to have a better air circulation or to have a panorama view if there are no clouds in the sky. Not all tents have a mesh as an inner tent (e.g. Hilleberg) and you need to purchase it separately.

### Which tent should I choose in different environments?
Are you hiking in a protected area like a forest or an unprotected area like on a hill or mountain which requires a stronger tent.

### Which tent should I choose for different seasons?
Do you plan to use your tent during 3 or 4 seasons (winter)? The fabric of the tent has an impact on the weight and the durability of the tent. Of course 4 season tents will have a stronger fabric but will also weight much more. Hilleberg for example gives an good overview of the [tear strength](http://www.hilleberg.com/home/tent_info/tearstrength.php "Tear Strength Hilleberg") of the fabrics they are using for their products.

### Does a tent need a vestibule?
Do you need a vestibule to store gear or cook when it's raining?

## What is the best size and weight of a tent for hiking or backpacking?
Do you want to have a tent which packs small so it fits into your backpack when going hiking (an ultralight tent) or can the tent be bigger and heavier since you are transporting it with a kayak or packraft?

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX on our packrafting trip in Scotland in February 2016.

## Conclusion
It's quite hard to say which tent is the best. It all depends on your needs and where you are planning to use the tent. Currently, we are using the MSR Hubba Hubba NX and the Anjan 3 (see also [here](http://www.hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/ "Hilleberg Anjan Tent")) which are great tents for spring, summer and autumn. The only disadvantage with the Anjan 3 is that it is not freestanding but we didn't have any issues so far on any of our trips to find a place to pitch it. However, I would recommend getting the Nallo 3 instead of the Anjan.

---

### What is the best 4-season tent for 1 person?
If I were to choose a new tent then I would probably choose the [Hilleberg Soulo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Soulo-1-Person-Tent_10101479_10208_10000001_-1_) as a 1-person and 4-season tent since I would prefer to have a freestanding tent for packrafting and kayaking. However, if you are 180 cm or taller then the Hilleberg Soulo might be too short for you. Alternatively, the Hilleberg Nallo 2 would be a good choice if you are taller or want more space.

---

### What is the best 3-season tent for 1 person?
In my opinion the [MSR Hubba Hubba NX](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-tent-2-person-3-season) or the [Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL1](https://www.rei.com/product/895953/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul1-tent) are the best 3-season tents available. However, we also found that the thin floor fabric on the MSR Hubba Hubba NX could cause an issue if you are planning to camp a lot or you just have to be a bit careful where you pitch your tent. I would probably not consider buying the new MSR Carbon Reflex or MSR FreeLite tents as they are having an even thinner floor fabric than the MSR Hubba NX. However, if you don't mind their delicate fabric then they are one of the best tents if you want to be fast and light on the trail. There is also the [MSR Hubba Gear Shed](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_MSR-Hubba-Gear-Shed_10271838_10208_10000001_-1_) available which you can attach to the MSR Hubba NX or the MSR Hubba Hubba NX. The gear shed could be quite useful to protect your gear.

If you do winter camping then it's probably a good idea to get an even bigger tent like the [Hilleberg Kaitum](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Kaitum-2-Person-Tent_10101437_10208_10000001_-1_) or [Nammatj](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Nammatj-GT-2-Person-Tent_10101469_10208_10000001_-1_).
