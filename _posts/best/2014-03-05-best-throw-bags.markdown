Here is my <a href="#table">selection</a>  of the best lightweight fleece jackets for 2018 which I would consider to buy for my next hiking or backpacking adventure.

Here is my [selection](#the-best-fleece-jackets-of-2018) of the best lightweight fleece jackets for 2017 - 2018 which I would consider to buy for my next hiking or backpacking adventure.

For wet conditions a fleece jacket is a much better choice than a [down jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-down-jackets/) to protect yourself against the cold as down will lose it’s insulation once it’s wet. An alternative to a fleece jacket would be a [synthetic insulated jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-synthetic-insulated-jackets/) which has the advantage of being windproof.

A fleece jacket can be used as a mid-layer to keep you warm while you are active (climbing, hiking, skiing or biking) and dries rather fast compared to other fabrics like cotton.

Have a look on our [FAQ](#faq-on-fleece-jackets) to learn more about fleece jackets.

### Fabric of fleece jackets

Fleece jackets come in different fabrics and depending on the material a fleece jacket can be more stretchy, offers better insulation or is more comfortable to wear.

**Polartec Classic 100** is the most basic fleece fabric and in most cases sufficient if you go hiking. It is probably also the least expensive fabric offered by Polartec.

**Polartec Thermal Pro** is similar as the Classic 100 fabric and was developed to add more styles and offers better efficiency.

**Polartec Power Stretch** might be more interesting for those folks going climbing since it is more stretchy.

---

### Zippers
 Zippers can add an additional function to your fleece jacket. Either as a pocket zipper or to open and close your jacket.

If you are more into Ultra-light hiking then zippers won't be probably that appealing to you since they add on weight. However, in some cases a zipper to open or close your jacket can be more comfortable. Pocket zippers might be useful if you want to store safely small items or tools.

---

### Thumbholes
Fleece jackets with thumbholes offers additional protection and insulation during the winter when wearing gloves.

---

### Hood or no Hood?
I prefer to have a fleece jacket without a hood because it makes the fleece jacket more versatile and it's more comfortable to wear under another jacket. You can always carry an additional hat with you in case you need one.

---

### Bluesign System
Bluesign approved textiles have been manufactured from the beginning of the manufacturing process in a sustainable way and without the use of harmful substances.

### Combining a fleece jacket with other clothes

A good idea is also to combine a fleece jacket with a [wind jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-windjackets/). A wind jacket protects you from cold winds while the fleece jacket offers insulation.

Fleece jackets are not windproof and you won’t sweat that much in a wind jacket than in a rain jacket when you are hiking. When it starts raining you can exchange your wind jacket with a [rain jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/rain-jackets-2017/).
