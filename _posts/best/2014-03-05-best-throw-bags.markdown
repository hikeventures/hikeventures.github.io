Here is my <a href="#table">selection</a>  of the best lightweight fleece jackets for 2018 which I would consider to buy for my next hiking or backpacking adventure.

Here is my [selection](#the-best-fleece-jackets-of-2018) of the best lightweight fleece jackets for 2017 - 2018 which I would consider to buy for my next hiking or backpacking adventure.

For wet conditions a fleece jacket is a much better choice than a [down jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-down-jackets/) to protect yourself against the cold as down will lose it’s insulation once it’s wet. An alternative to a fleece jacket would be a [synthetic insulated jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-synthetic-insulated-jackets/) which has the advantage of being windproof.

A fleece jacket can be used as a mid-layer to keep you warm while you are active (climbing, hiking, skiing or biking) and dries rather fast compared to other fabrics like cotton.

Have a look on our [FAQ](#faq-on-fleece-jackets) to learn more about fleece jackets.
