Here is my <a href="#table">selection</a> of the best life jackets or PFDs for Packrafting and Kayaking in 2018.

As we are frequently on packrafting trips we are always interested to find new packrafting gear like.

The life jackets in this blog post are also suitable for Kayaking. In fact they have probably been designed with Kayakers in mind as I have not heard about specific packrafting life jackets yet (nor do I think that there would be much of a difference).

## How to choose the best PFD?

The best PFD for your next packrafting adventure depends on where you are planning to packraft.

Are you planning to packraft in a strong rapid then you probably need more capable PFD  than packrafting on a calm lake.

Also when you plan to packraft in the open sea you should look for a PFD which can also handle stormy sea conditions as the weather can also change quickly on the sea.

Of course, you should always check the weather conditions before you go packrafting on the sea. Packrafts are actually not meant to be used on the sea but we have also paddled on the Baltic Sea in Finland and it worked quite well with our windpaddle sail.

PFD’s are categorised by [pfdma.org](http://pfdma.org) into different classes (USCG and State Law Enforcement agencies require and/or recommend different Types of lifejackets for different applications) and I would recommend to read through the [pfdma.org](http://pfdma.org) pages to make sure that you select the right one if you live in the U.S.

We are usually wearing a dry suite when we go packrafting and we would rate the difficulty of the river which we are usually paddling between class 2 and class 3.

The following PFD’s are quite light and can also be carried with your backpack like the [HMG Porter 4400](http://www.hikeventures.com/gear-review-hmg-porter-4400-black/) which is our go-to packrafting backpack.

<hr>

## Inflatable PFD's

We would not recommend inflatable PFD’s.

Of course they are not that bulky than regular PFD’s but we don’t feel that they are that safe like regular PFD’s.

However, if you are still interested in an inflatable PFD then you could probably have a look into the [MTI Fuid 2.0.](https://www.rei.com/product/869119/mti-fluid-20-belt-pack-inflatable-pfd)

<hr>

## Conclusion

Wearing a PFD does not need to be a burden. The latest PFD’s are quite stylish and we hope that we were able to give you some good ideas on which PFD you could get for yourself.

We are currently wearing the Palm Alpha and the Astral Designs YTV PFDs. The Astral Designs V-Eight life jacket was also quite popular among a few paddlers who participated in the [Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016. ](http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/)

It’s probably a good idea to invest a bit money into a good PFD if you plan to go packrafting frequently. Safety goes first!
