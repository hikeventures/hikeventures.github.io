I have tried a couple of water bottles in the past when I went hiking, backpacking or packrafting and of course you can also get along with an average water bottle from the grocery store but the Nalgene is so far the best water bottle for our hiking, backpacking or packrafting activities.

It's quite easy to read how much water is left in the Nalgene bottle due to the large printing. What's more, the Nalgene bottle is also BPA free. The tag also states that you can wash the Nalgene bottle in a dish washer. The weight of the bottle is 179 grams and can handle a temperature range from -40C to 100C.

The large opening of the bottle makes it quite easy to use a water purifier like the Kathadyn Mini Filter. You can also easily add ice cubes into the Nalgene water bottle.

Initially, I was reluctant to buy this water bottle as I thought it's just an average plastic bottle which you can get much cheaper. But if I think of the advantages (e.g. that it's BPA free) and that I will use it quite often then I think it's worth the investment and would recommend the Nalgene everyday bottle for hiking and backpacking trips. Alternatively, if you want to have a filter integrated into the bottle then you could also have a look into this [solution][1].
