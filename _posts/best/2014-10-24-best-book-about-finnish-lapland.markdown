Lapland is definitely a place worth to visit if you are into Hiking / Bakpacking or Packrafting. However, it's also good to know the history, nature and culture if you are planning to visit a new hiking destination. For Finnish Lapland I would definitely recommend you the Crossbill Guide for Finnish Lapland including Kuusamo.

When I was searching for a good book about Finnish Lapland, I found it quite hard to find a good book which is dedicated to hiking and available in English. The main resource I use for my trips  in Finland is usually <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi" target="_blank">Outdoors.fi</a> also due to the lack of good books in this field available in English.

The book has been published by the <a href="http://www.crossbillguides.com/" target="_blank">Crossbill Guides Foundation</a> in the Netherlands together with <a href="http://www.metsa.fi" target="_blank">Metsähallitus</a> in Finland, WILDGuides, KNNV Publishing and Saxifraga foundation. Metsähallitus is a state owned organization in Finland which is responsible for the National Parks and also operates the <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi" target="_blank">Outdoors.fi</a> website. So the data in the book seems to come from a reliable source.

On the Crossbill Guides website you can also find more material related to Finnish Lapland and some sample pages of the book e.g. a wildflower list.

## Structure
The book is structured:

* Landscape
* Flora and Fauna
* Practical Part (Route descriptions)
* Tourist information and observation tips
* Glossary
* Acknowledgements
* Pictures and illustration credist
* Species list and translation

## Readability and Pictures
The text is easy to read and supported by many color pictures, topographical maps, route descriptions and small illustrations on what can be found on the trails and how long it takes to complete them. There is also a translation of the species list available in English, Scientific, German and Dutch.

## Conclusion
The Crossbill Guide for Finnish Lapland including Kuusamo is a very good book which introduces you to the main hiking routes in Finnish Lapland, it's history, climate and flora and fauna (e.g. boreal forest, bogs, birds, insects  or the differences between national parks, strict nature reserves or wilderness reserves etc.). I would definitely recommend it for your bookshelf.

You can get the book at Amazon <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/1z4hw9m" target="_blank">US</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1trCRWQ" target="_blank">EU</a> (affiliate link).
