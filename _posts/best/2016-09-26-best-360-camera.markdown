As we are always interested in new camera gear for our next adventure I was interested to find out which waterproof 360 4K cameras are currently available which I could take to my next hiking, backpacking, skiing or packrafting trip.

I picked 360 cameras which were somewhat water resistant and shockproof.

YouTube already supports 360 videos so you could get for example a <a href="http://amzn.to/2eRm0Kz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google Cardboard</a> and attach it to your smartphone.

Have a look on our <a href="#list">comparison table</a> to find the right camera or see some <a href="#example">pictures</a> of the camera models which we recommend.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
On paper, the Nikon makes a good impression with it's aperture and and higher IPX8 rating. However, the 360fly has quite a few features built-in which are missing on the Nikon. The decision which camera to pick on your next adventure is up to you.
