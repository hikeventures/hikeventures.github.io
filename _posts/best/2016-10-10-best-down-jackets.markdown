In this blog post, I have selected the [best down jackets](#down-jacket-features-table) of 2017 - 2018 which I would consider buying if I were to get a new one for my next backpacking or winter adventure.

A down jacket is an essential piece of clothes when planning an overnight trip outdoors or during winter time. A down jacket keeps you much warmer compared to a fleece jacket.

Further, down jackets are designed for different activities or environments e.g. urban or outdoor adventures.

Usually, I wear a [fleece jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-fleece-jackets/) as a mid-layer when I go hiking. When it get’s windy I pull on a [wind jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-windjackets/).  If I sit around in my camp I switch my fleece to a down jacket.

Moreover, I rather carry a [synthetic insulated jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-synthetic-insulated-jackets/) with me than a down jacket if I am planning to go hiking in damp or humid conditions as down may not insulate very well once it get’s wet.

Also, have a look at our [FAQ](#faq-on-down-jackets) to learn more about down jackets.

**Weight**: 880 grams / 31 oz.

More heavy than the other jackets in our list, the Arc’teryx Ceres SV Parka is made for the deep winter where warmth is the most important factor.

The jacket comes with 850 fill down insulation and its GORE® WINDSTOPPER® fabric protects you from cold winds. The shell of the jacket is also water repellent and windproof. The jacket also comes with a helmet compatible insulated Cohaesive™ hood StormHood™ to protect you from the elements which can also be adjusted with gloves or mittens on.

The jacket comes with a box wall construction meaning less cold spots and more loft. The jacket also features Coreloft™ synthetic insulation in places where moisture could have an impact on down insulation.

The Ceres SV Parka offers a great warmth-to-weight ratio, compressibility, and packability.

**Weight**: 275 grams / 9.7 oz.

We would pick the Cerium LT Hoody for moderate winter trips or for spring or autumn backcountry adventures.

The Arc'teryx Cerium LT Hoody is a lightweight down jacket which can be worn as a mid layer or as an outer layer.

It comes with 850 down fill and has an excellent warmth-to-weight ratio.

The Arato™ 10 nylon shell is lightweight and durable and synthetic insulation has been applied on areas where moisture could build up. The Cerium LT Hoody also comes with a DWR finish.

The jacket has an articulated design which adjusts to your body movements.

There is also an insulated StormHood™, adjustable hood and hem drawcord and elasticized cuffs at wrist. Further, the jacket has a full front zip with chin guard.

The jacket has an internal zippered security pocket with a stuff sack. LT stands for lightweight in the Arc’teryx product line.

## Arc'teryx Cerium SV Hoody (850 fill)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GW80Q9E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GW80Q9E&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=WCQGDJJ5MREZ5EUX"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00GW80Q9E&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00GW80Q9E" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="Arcteryx Cerium SV Hoody" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight**: 440 grams / 15.5 oz.

The Arc’teryx Cerium SV Hoody is part of Arc’teryx severe weather product line - most durable materials which provides most weather protection.

We would wear this jacket during the winter. For camping during spring and summer, it’s probably going to be a bit too warm as the jacket was designed as the ultimate cold weather mid-layer or a standalone solution.

A baffle structure keeps the 850 down fill lofty and the down insulated StormHood™ and glove mitten-friendly Cohaesive™ adjusters are welcoming features for winter activities as well.

Synthetic insulation is strategically used on certain areas of this jacket as well.

## Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka (625 fill)

**Weight**: 2070 grams / 73 oz.

The Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka was originally designed for scientists in Antarctica.

This is probably the warmest jacket in our selection and Canada Goose rates it as TEI 5 which means that it's suitable for temperatures of -30°C and below. Further, the jacket has been field-tested on the coldest places on earth.

The downside of this jacket is probably its weight. With 2073 grams (73 oz.) it's more on the heavy site on our weight scale filled with 625 fill down.

The Canada Goose ARCTIC TECH fabric Water Resistant is wind, and water resistant, durable and warm consisting of an 85% Polyester and 15% cotton mixture.

The jacket features an adjustable, non-removable hood, a fur ruff, fleece-lined chin guard, interior back pack shoulder straps, six exterior pockets, four large handwarmer pockets, two interior pockets an adjustable waist drawcords as well as a hideaway snow skirt.

## Marmot Quasar Hoody (900 fill)

**Weight**: 372 grams / 13.5 oz

The Marmot Quasar Hoody is also an interesting jacket with its high 850-fill down covered by durable ultralight 10-denier Pertex® Quantum® fabric which makes it also somewhat water repellent.

The additional zip on the front, however, adds a little bit more weight to the jacket.

We would wear the Marmot Quasar Hoody as a mid-layer under a shell during moderate winter trips or on spring and summer adventures.

The jacket adjusts to your movements and features an elastic draw cord hem and cuss as well as an adjustable hood. You can also pack the jacket in its pocket.

**Weight**: 212 grams / 7.5 oz.

The Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer Hooded Down Jacket is one of the lightest hooded down jackets available.

This is a great jacket for camping during spring, summer and autumn or as a light mid-layer under your shell jacket. It can also be compressed and packs into its own pocket.

The Q.Shield™ DOWN 800-fill is also resistant towards moisture and the down will keep you longer insulated. The jacket also features elastic cuff and adjustable toggle hem. The shell of the jacket consists of Whisperer 7D x 10D Ripstop.

If you are looking for a proper winter jacket then we would rather pick the Rab Infinity Endurance or the Rab Positron jacket.

The Rab Infinity Endurance Jacket is a light-weight technical alpine or mountaineering jacket featuring a helmet-compatible hood and a stitch-through baffle construction. Moreover, there is an internal security pocket elasticated cuffs and a hem drawcord.

It’s high fill power and low weight makes this probably one of the best lightweight winter down jackets. The shell of the jacket is a combination of Pertex® Endurance and Pertex® Quantum fabrics.

The jacket contains 210 grams of 850-fill goose down. However, if you need a warmer jacket then the Rab Positron Jacket would probably be a better alternative which adds approximately 30% more warmth.

### When to wear?
Down jackets are best worn when it’s not that humid. I have down jackets for different seasons. A thin down jacket for chilly 3-season trips when I go backpacking and another thicker down jacket when I go for example on a winter trip to Lapland.

---

### What is fill power?
Fill power indicates the fluffiness of down. The more fluffy the down the less down I need compared to less fluffy down. Jackets with high fill power are usually more expensive than down jackets with less fill power.

---

### How to wash?
I wash my down jacket by hand. However, you can also gently wash your down jacket in a washing machine. You can also use a special <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=150351&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F890310%2Fnikwax-down-wash-direct" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">washing liquid</a> for down.

---

### How to fluff?
A big tumbler can be used to dry the down jacket. Also, add a few tennis balls to get the down fluffy.

---

### How to pack and store it?
I have one dedicated dry bag where I stuff my down jacket and my sleeping bag in. Down products need much less space than synthetic products and the best way to get as much space as possible is to compress down in a compression bag.

---

### Down feathers are coming out
Sometimes down feathers are coming out through the fabric. In this case, try to pull them back into the down jacket. Don't pull them out. You may also try to fluff the down in your jacket so they won't be able to fit through small holes in the fabric anymore.

---

### What is water resistant down?
Compared to normal down, water resistant down has been treated with a water resistant coating. This means that it will be a bit more resistant towards moisture. However, if you are planning to travel to a place where you expect a lot of moisture then you should probably consider a [jacket with synthetic insulation](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-synthetic-insulated-jackets/).
