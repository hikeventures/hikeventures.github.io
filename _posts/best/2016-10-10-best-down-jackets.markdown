<br>

Do you need a new warm down jacket for the winter or for a cold summer night during a hike? Here is our <a href="#list">selection</a> of the best down jackets for 2017 which we have selected to cover your summer and winter backcountry trips.

We have selected a broad range of down jackets which can be worn in different conditions and for different activities like hiking, backpacking, skiing, snowboarding, mountaineering, climbing or on any other outdoor adventure.

The down jackets we have selected have a fill power of 800 and more since they offer the best warmth-weight ratio and are considered to be lightweight down jackets and pack small and light. We have also included very warm down parkas with lower fill power but they are suitable for very cold conditions. Moreover, our selection includes 3-season down jacket as well as winter down jackets.

The lighter jackets usually come with less down and are more suitable for warmer months or as a mid-layer during the winter. Some people also prefer synthetic insulation rather than down. However, keep in mind that synthetic insulation is more bulky and offers less insulation than down. Synthetic insulation might be a better choice in very damp or wet conditions.

<hr>

Sometimes you might also get a down jacket for a significant lower price especially at the end of the season when stores want to clear their stock. In many cases the new models just come with a different color so it's worth to have a look on the old models as well.

**Weight:** 212g

The Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer Hooded Down Jacket is one of the lightest down jackets available. This is a great jacket for camping during spring, summer and autumn or as a light mid-layer for the winter. If you are looking for a proper winter jacket then we would rather pick the Rab Infinity Endurance or the Rab Positron jacket. For a stylish jacket to use during winter mainly in town we would go for the Arcteryx Ceres jacket.

**Weight:** 275g

Similar as the Arcteryx Cerium LT Jacket just with a hoodie. We would pick the Cerium LT Hoody if we would have to choose a down jacket for moderate winter or for camping during spring and autumn. LT stands for lightweight in the Arcteryx product line.

**Weight:** 372g

The Marmot Quasar Hoody is also an interesting jacket with it's high down fill power covered by light Pertex Quantum fabric (similar as other models in our list) which makes it also somewhat water repellent. The additional zip on the front adds a little bit more weight to the jacket. We would wear the Marmot Quasar Hoody during moderate winter or camping during spring and summer.

**Weight:** 440g

The Arcteryx Cerium SV Hoody is part of Arcteryx severe weather product line - most durable materials which provides most weather protection. We would wear this jacket during the winter. For camping during spring and summer it's probably going to be a bit too warm.

## FAQ on Down Jackets

### When not to wear a down jacket?

You should avoid wearing your down-jacket while you are active (e.g. hiking, biking, climbing or skiing) since down insulates less when it gets wet. So ideally you wear a [fleece jacket][17] when you are active and switch to your down jacket when you are resting.

---

### When not to wear a down jacket?

You should avoid wearing your down-jacket while you are active (e.g. hiking, biking, climbing or skiing) since down insulates less when it gets wet. So ideally you wear a [fleece jacket][18] when you are active and switch to your down jacket when you are resting.

---

### What is down quality?

A high down quality indicates that less down is needed to keep you warm for the same weight (e.g. a fill power of 900 keeps you more warm than a fill power of 700 with the same amount of down) - having higher warmth-to-weight ratio. A down jacket with the highest fill power and the lightest shell fabric can be considered an ultralight down jacket. Fill power is measured by cuin. A ratio of 90:10 expresses the down-feather ratio (90% down and 10% feathers).

---

### Are down jackets waterproof?

The shell of your down jacket is slightly water repellent in order to keep the down dry in case you get into very light rain. If you expect to get more rain, swap the down jacket with a [fleece jacket][19] and pull on a [rain jacket][20]. So in general, down jackets are not waterproof.

---

### How are down jackets designed?

The baffles of a down jacket keep the down in place. There are two possibilities to create those baffles:

* Stitch-through baffles (stitches are the areas where cold can come through the jacket)
* Box wall baffles (better option as there are no areas on the jacket which are not filled with down as opposed to the stitch-through design).

---

### Should a down jacket have a hood?

We would go for a hooded down jacket, as you can use the hood also in your sleeping bag if temperatures drop below of what your sleeping bag is capable to handle.

---

### What is the difference in traditional and hydrophobic down (or HydroDown)?

Hydrophobic down does not absorb water that quickly as traditional down. A hydrophobic down jacket keeps its insulation longer than a traditional down jacket if it gets wet.

---

### Down jackets compared to synthetic filled jackets

Synthetic filled jackets keep you dry even so when they are wet. Disadvantages of a synthetic filled jacket is it's shorter life and it takes more space to pack it in the backpack. It also weights more to deliver the same amount of warmth compared to a down filled jacket. Down is more durable than synthetic fill, more breathable, windproof but also dries slower. A wet down jacket also weights more than a wet synthetic jacket since it absorbs more water. Usually, we carry our down jacket and sleeping bag in a waterproof stuff sack if we don't need them.

---

### Which design features are important on a down jacket?

To keep the warmth inside your jacket, a waist drawstring and wrist closures (e.g. Velcro) are important features. Pockets and a hood are useful as well. The hood should be sewed to the jacket if you want to get maximum warmth. Less pockets and zippers on a down jacket can also reduce weight.

---

### Which fabric shell should be used on a lightweight down jacket?

Many new down jackets feature nowadays a light ripstop shell to make the down jacket a bit resistant against moisture. One disadvantage of those light ripstop shells is that they are not very durable and if it starts raining your down jacket will still soak up water. However, we found them to be sufficient as we usually only wear a down jacket to walk around in camp or as an additional layer in my sleeping bag. So in general, we don't find it important to have a waterproof down jacket which would also lower the breathability of the down jacket.

---

### Should a down jacket have a hood?

We would go for a hooded down jacket, as you can use the hood also in your sleeping bag if temperatures drop below of what your sleeping bag is capable to handle.

---

### How to clean a down jacket?

The best way to clean a down jacket is to wash it inside out in a washing machine with very low speed. As washing liquid we always use Nikwax Downwash and sometimes additionally Nikwax Downproof to make the down a bit more resistant against moisture.

---

### What is the difference in traditional and hydrophobic down (or HydroDown)?

Hydrophobic down does not absorb water that quickly as traditional down. A hydrophobic down jacket keeps its insulation longer than a traditional down jacket if it gets wet.

---

### Down jackets compared to synthetic filled jackets

Synthetic filled jackets keep you dry even so when they are wet. Disadvantages of a synthetic filled jacket is it's shorter life and it takes more space to pack it in the backpack. It also weights more to deliver the same amount of warmth compared to a down filled jacket. Down is more durable than synthetic fill, more breathable, windproof but also dries slower. A wet down jacket also weights more than a wet synthetic jacket since it absorbs more water. Usually, we carry our down jacket and sleeping bag in a waterproof stuff sack if we don't need them.

So in general, we don't find it important to have a waterproof down jacket which would also lower the breathability of the down jacket.

---

### How to keep a down jacket dry?

You can keep your down jacket dry by storing it in a waterproof compression bag when you are hiking in wet conditions and to use your down jacket only in your tent.

Chris:	Well, here's the first. This is the Extrem 8000 Pro Jacket, which has just won an ISPO Gold Award, about which we are very pleased. This is the most technical jacket in the Berghaus range. It sits in the Extrem, the pinnacle range that Berghaus makes, and it won the award for three fantastic innovations all called Xpanse. 

There's the Xpanse Back, which provides amazing freedom of movement. When you need to stretch, or move around, the back of your ... This area here. It's a basically a panel. It expands, and then retracts when you don't need it. 

The Xpanse Hood, which uses a system of magnets. When you're in full winter conditions, you've got a climbing helmet, but of course you've got a hood with a lot of volume. When you need it, you can get that volume by expanding it, but then it clips back into place using those magnets, so you don't get the excess fabric moving around in the wind when you don't need it, and you don't want it. 

Finally, there's the Xpanse face guard there, to which you can zip away when you don't need it, but when you're in full winter conditions, but you don't want to get too steamed up, you've got that face guard with the little holes there that allows you to continue to operate at optimum level in the worst conditions. 
	
That's the Extrem 8000 Pro Jacket, which will be available from autumn/winter 2016

Konstantin:	Chris, can you tell us something about this product as well. 

Chris:	Yeah. This is called the Ramche 2.0, which is a Berghaus down jacket, expedition level down jacket. 850 filled power goose down. Hydrophobic down, so it repels water, will continue to perform when it gets wet, and the treatment on that is powered by NikWax, so it's PFC-free, which is an important sustainability message. 

The Ramche is very special for the kid, and it's been tested by our mountaineer Mick Fowler in the worst conditions in the Himalayas. It's been thermally ... Sorry. There are three zones of body mapping in this down, so you get the extra heat where you need it most, and you get lower levels of down where you need heat to escape when you're moving fast in the outdoors. 

The baffles are stitched through baffles on the outside and the inside, but they're offset like that, so you don't get any cold spots throughout the product. Between the two layers of down baffles there is reflect mesh, which is aluminum infused mesh that reflects heat back into the jacket, and makes it even warmer than you might expect it to be. 

The face fabric is an extremely tough and lightweight face fabric that repels water, windproof ...

Konstantin:	Rip stop.

Chris:	Rip stop, and in fact, Mick Fowler, our sponsored mountaineer, got it. He was testing a prototype, and he got it caught in his belay device while he was abseiling, and he thought, "Oh, no. I'm going to end up with down everywhere. There'll be feathers all over this mountain." He abseiled, I think it was about ... Completed his 50 foot abseil, and the fabric was marked, but it wasn't torn, so it's extremely tough for it's weight. 

You've got all that you'd expect from a full mountain down jacket, and it weights under 500 grams. Really lightweight. Really tough. Really warm. Really thermally efficient. It's the Ramche 2.0 from Berghaus. This again fits in the Extrem range. 

By the way, Extrem has been part of the Berghaus collection since 1986, so this is a 30th birthday of our pinnacle range. It's a really big year for the collection, which has been completely relaunched for 2016.

Konstantin:	I'm with Gilles from Rab here. What are the three, two, three most exciting products of your line?

Gilles:	For autumn/winter 2016?

Konstantin:	Yes. 

Gilles:	We have the Zero G jacket, which is a 1000 fill power down jacket. At Rab we are specialists in down clothing and down sleeping bags. This is the lightest thousand fill power down jacket that we're launching for autumn/winter 16. It's the pinnacle of technology in our business. It really highlights the brand. 

Then we have this synthetic filled ... This is a synthetic fill jacket, which copes really well with slightly wetter conditions, and can be worn as an outer layer, or a mid-layer. That's selling really, really well in the shops now. Then I'll show you the third thing.

This is Merino+, which is our new base layer technology. This is a combination of Merino wool and impregnated polyester. It really is the best of both worlds. The handle is really, really soft, and it's comfortable against the skin. It's got a really broad activity use from really cold conditions where you're moving slowly, to warmer conditions where you're moving a bit quicker. 

It's like the best of both worlds. Best of Merino and best of synthetic. That's available in the shops now, but in the winter it will be called Merino+. 

Our 2016 campaign is going to be called "Alpine Defined." That's the direction for Rab for 2016. 

Konstantin:	Thank you very much Gilles.
