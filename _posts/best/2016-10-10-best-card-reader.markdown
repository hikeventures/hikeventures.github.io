If you recently got one of the latest laptops or a MacBook Pro you will probably need a USB-C to USB adapter or a dedicated USB-C card reader to read your SD or MicroSD cards.

Some cameras also allow to wirelessly transfer data to the computer by using Wifi but this might be a slower option than transferring the data by using a card reader.

I have only tested the Satechi Aluminum Type-C USB 3.0 Micro/SD Card Reader.

The other card readers were also on my list before I made my purchase decision which was based on that I just wanted to have a very small device.

The Satechi Type-C Card Reader is currently the card reader I am using on my Macbook Pro 2016. You can fit in both an SD card and a Micro SD card which can be used simultaneously.

Further, you can also connect it to a USB or a USB-C port which makes it quite flexible concerning the ports on your laptop.

Also if you are on a budget then this is probably a better solution than the one offered by SanDisk on the Apple website, however it is not UHS-II compliant.

## Conclusion
Depending on your needs and your budget there are several solutions available to transfer your pictures and videos from your camera to your PC or MacBook.

It's also worth to find out if your camera is able to transfer your pictures by using Wifi.

Transferring the pictures won't be that fast as with a dedicated card reader but it's a working solution in case you are on a budget, have no need for any other USB or Ethernet features or want to avoid additional dongles on your laptop.
