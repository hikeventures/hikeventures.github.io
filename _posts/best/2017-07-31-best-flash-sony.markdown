In this blog post I want to show you [my selection](#the-best-flash-for-sony-cameras) of the best flash which I would consider to buy for my Sony a7.

The flash in this post can also be used on the Sony a9 or a6500 since they share the same hotshoe.

Also have a quick look on my [Flash FAQ](#faq) before you buy a new Flash. Here which [camera bags]([http://www.hikeventures.com/best-camera-bags-cases](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-camera-bags-cases/)/) or [travel tripods](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-travel-tripods-sony/) I would recommend.

## FAQ

* [Difference between aluminum and carbon tripod](#difference-between-aluminum-and-carbon-tripod)
* [Difference between a light and heavy tripod](#difference-between-a-light-and-heavy-tripod)


### Difference between aluminum and carbon tripod

Carbon is lighter than aluminum and is also more weather resistant. A carbon tripod might also be a good choice if you are planning to take pictures at the beach as salt water may not harm carbon that much.

An additional layer usually protects the aluminum tripods from erosion. However, sand could cause small scratches to that layer and the tripod may suffer from erosion.

Another advantage of an aluminum tripod over a carbon tripod is that it’s less expensive.

### Difference between a light and heavy tripod

A heavy tripod might be not suitable for traveling however it has some benefits over a lighter tripod. First of all you can load more weight on it e.g. heavier lenses and equipment and it’s not going to vibrate that much when you are shooting in a windy environment.

A heavier tripod could be also useful if you are planning to use a slider with your tripod.
