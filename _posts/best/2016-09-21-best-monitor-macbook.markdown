As I am planning to buy a new MacBook Pro I was curious to find out which monitor I should get to connect it with my new MacBook Pro and what would be <a href="#table">the best alternative</a> to the LG UltraFine 4K or 5K monitors.

Having a headlamp can be a life saver, and it’s a good idea to have one with you in your backpack especially during the winter.

I really would like to have an external 4K or 5K monitor with my MacBook Pro since it is much more convenient to edit pictures.

In the past I had a 27" HD monitor to edit my pictures but since I am planning to take 4K videos in the near future I would be really nice to have a 4K or even a 5K screen.

I really like the idea to have less cables on my desk so USB-C would be a really nice feature.

There would be no need to plug and unplug USB cables anymore on the MacBook Pro. All my USB cables would be connected to my monitor and there would be just one single USB-C which is connected to my MacBook Pro.

## HP ENVY 27

<a  target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3YVA0P/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01N3YVA0P&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=3e874bc4ca2788c4625ac6832f65d82f"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01N3YVA0P&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01N3YVA0P" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="HP ENVY 27" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The HP ENVY is a 4K display can power a PC or a mobile device. With a reaction time of 14 ms the HP ENVY might not be a monitor for gaming but for everything else this monitor could be a nice solution for an affordable price.

## Conclusion
On paper, the Lenovo seems to have an edge for those working with pictures while the LG would be more a gaming monitor.

However, the differences between those 2 monitors is not that big and it's probably just a matter of taste and money you are planning to spend on your new monitor.

 If you have the cash I would rather take the Dell Ultra HD 5K than a 4K screen. If you are on a budget then the HP ENVY or the LG 27UD68P (especially for gaming) might be a nice 4K monitor.
