Proper hiking boots are important if you are planning to hike in the mountains or with a heavy backpack. For day trips which are not that demanding [lightweight hiking shoes](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-ultralight-hiking-shoes/) could be an alternative to traditional hiking boots. However, after my trips in the [Alps](http://www.hikeventures.com/e5-crossing-the-alps-from-germany-to-italy/) and in [Swedish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/) I am not such a fan of ultralight hiking shoes and would rather take a pair of proper hiking boots with me. Here is my selection of the best hiking boots for 2016 - 2017.

# Conclusion
A proper hiking shoe is one of the most important item on your hiking gear list. Consider the environment where you would like to hike. Do you want lighter or more stable hiking boots? A higher shaft gives you more stability if you have to carry a heavy backpack. It might be also a good idea to get regular hiking boots and lightweight hiking shoes if you are planning to do both - multiple days and day hikes.

# FAQ on Hiking Boots

## Regular hiking boots vs. shell hiking boots
If you live in Europe then you could also have a look on shell boots like the [Lundhags Jaure Light](http://www.lundhags.com/Products/Boots/Shell-Boots/3-layer-Boots/Jaure-Light-Mid/(color)/923) but they are mainly sold in Europe. Shell boots are a bit different than regular hiking boots and require you to wear 2 pair of socks. However, they dry faster if they get wet since there is no thick liner in the boots which require to dry. You just have to dry your socks and and the shoe inserts. The leather of the shoe will be a bit moisture but with proper <a href="http://amzn.to/287Cjc1" rel="nofollow">merino wool socks</a> you probably won't notice much of it. The [Arc'teryx Men's Bora2 Mid](http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-bora-mid-backpacking-boot-mens) is another example of a shell boot.

[Mid](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=mid+hiking+boots) hiking boots are a good option if you need somewhat anchle support and if you carry a medium weight backpack. Some people also hike entirely with [low](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=low+hiking+boots) hiking boots but for stability and protetion you should rather choose a hiking boot with a higher shaft.

A good sole manufacturere is probably Vibram.

Some manufacturers offers the option to replace the sole or repair your shoes if they wear off. However, if you are not that much in love with your hiking boots then you can also buy a new pair of hiking boots every 10 years or so.

## What is the right sizing of hiking boots?
It's a good idea to try on your hiking boots and test walk with them in the store before you buy them. Some shoes can also cause you blisters if they are new or if you buy them too small. To prevent blisters buy the shoes a little bit bigger and wear proper [merino socks](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=icebreaker+merino+socks+hike). If you are planning to buy shell hiking boots then you have to wear 2 pairs of socks. A liner and mid or heavy cushioning socks. Wearing two pairs of socks prevent you of getting blisters.

If you need arch support on your hiking boots then you should probably buy a seperate [insole](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=insoles+hiking) and replace it with the regular insole of your hiking boots.
