Here is my selection of the best hiking boots for 2017.  

Hiking boots are important if you are planning to hike in the mountains or if you have to carry a heavy backpack. Moreover, they should provide a good grip as well.  

For day trips which are not that demanding [lightweight hiking shoes](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-light-hiking-shoes/) could be an alternative to traditional hiking boots.  

However, after my trips in the [Alps](http://www.hikeventures.com/e5-crossing-the-alps-from-germany-to-italy/) and in [Swedish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/) I am not such a fan of ultralight hiking shoes and would rather take a pair of proper hiking boots with me.

## FAQ on Hiking Boots

## Regular hiking boots vs. shell hiking boots

If you live in Europe then you could also have a look on shell boots like the [Lundhags Jaure Light](http://www.lundhags.com/Products/Boots/Shell-Boots/3-layer-Boots/Jaure-Light-Mid/(color)/923) but they are mainly sold in Europe.   

Shell boots are a bit different from regular hiking boots and require you to wear 2 pair of socks.   

However, they dry faster if they get wet since there is no thick liner in the boots which require to dry.   

You just have to dry your socks and the shoe inserts. The leather of the shoe will be a bit moisture but with proper <a href="http://amzn.to/287Cjc1" rel="nofollow">merino wool socks</a> you probably won't notice much of it.   

<hr>

## Regular hiking boots vs. ultralight hiking boots

If you plan a hike in less demanding terrain or where you don't need much of ankle support because you don't have to carry a heavy backpack then you could also have a look on [lightweight hiking shoes](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-ultralight-hiking-shoes/) as an alternative to regular hiking boots.   

You will probably enjoy your hike more with lighter hiking boots.

## What is the average weight of hiking boots?

The average hiking boot weight is probably between 400 and 600 grams per shoe.   

There are also lightwieght hiking shoes available which weight below 300 grams per shoe.  

<hr>

## Are hiking boot bags useful?

Sometimes it's a good idea to pack your hiking boots into a hiking boot bag to keep the dirt away from your other gear.   

For packrafting I use a waterproof stuff sack to keep my hiking boots dry while paddling and attach the bag to my backpack in front of my packraft.   

<hr>

## How to choose hiking boots?

There are several factors on how you should choose your hiking boots. Some brands also categorise their boots into activities or the difficulty of your hike. A good example can be seen on the [Meindl website.](http://www.meindl.de/english/service/service_3.html)  

Heavier hiking boots with a high shaft are probably a good choice if you:  

* carry a heavy backpack  
* need ankle support  
* need waterproof shoes or protection to the ankle  

<hr>

## What to do against hurting toes?

If your toes are hurting in your hiking boots then you should consider getting a bigger pair of hiking boots.   

Alternatively, you could also try to wear thinner socks but in most cases your hiking boots are just too small.  

<hr>

## What materials are hiking boots made of?

Hiking boots are made of different materials. Examples are Nubuk leather, Gore-Tex liners or Cordura.   

If you are looking for a very breathable shoe then hiking boots which are entirely made of leather are probably a good option.  

<hr>

## Are hiking boots or trail runners better?

Some people prefer to wear trail runners rather than hiking boots. Trail runners are much lighter but do not offer the protection and stability offered by regular hiking boots.   

Sometimes you also get wet feet and you need to dry your trail runners nearby the camp fire.  

<hr>

## What is the sole material of hiking boots?

Good hiking boots should have a stiff sole. However, if you are planning to hike mostly on proper trails or roads then you can also choose hiking boots which do not have a stiff sole.  

<hr>

## Are hiking boots waterproof?

Should your hiking boots be waterproof? In most cases this is a good feature but it also has an impact on the breathability of your hiking boots.   

Try a pair of shell boots which are entirely made of leather. They offer good water protection and high breathability.
