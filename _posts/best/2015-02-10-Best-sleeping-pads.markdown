Another light sleeping pad is the Sea to Summit Ultralight which featuers a more durable fabric than the Therm-aRest Neo Air Xlite while the NeoAir Xlite will give you a better insulation.

The Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm is a sleeping pad for late spring, winter or early spring. However, in Scandinavia it is my go-to sleeping bag throughout the year.

**R-Value:** 2.6  
**Weight:**  410 g

The Therm-a-Rest Z LITE SOL is a foam sleeping pad which is a safe choice than an air sleeping pad. You can also use this pad in combination with an air sleeping pad to get the ultimate in comfort and insulation.

<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/2eIa0OZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Exped Synmat UL 7</a></h3>

**R-Value:** 3.3  
**Weight:** 450 g

The Exped Synmat UL 7 was my go-to sleeping pad for a couple of years, however I have replaced it with the Therm-a-Rest XTherm as it offers a better insulation / weight ratio.

<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/2dBNswR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Therm-a-Rest EvoLite</a></h3>

**R-Value:** 2.1  
**Weight:** 520 g
**Fabric:** 30D  

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZKXB2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PZKXB2Y&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=7de4b697126cb0f135e9550bf812d9fc" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00PZKXB2Y&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00PZKXB2Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

If you don't want to spend so much time inflating your sleeping pad then the Therm-a-Rest EvoLite might be an intersting sleeping pad for the summer. However, the foam of the pad makes it a heavier choice and you don't get such a good insulation as in other air pads.

## How to choose the best sleeping pad?

* Weight (do you want an ultralight sleeping pad?)
* Size (does it need to pack small?)
* Pad for summer, winter, or 4-season?
* Sleeping area (do I need a bigger size because I am a big guy?)
* Ease of inflate / deflate
* Is weight more important to me than comfort?
* Durability (a thinner fabric may be less durable / may not be that puncture resistant)
* Do I want to have a  inflatable mattress, a self-inflating pad or a camping foam?
* Are the edges of the pad supportive?
* Does the pad slip easily in the tent?
* Does the pad make noise when I sleep on it (ear plugs might help)?

---

## Which R-value is the best for which season when choosing a sleeping pad?
The R-value of a Sleeping Pad indicates the thermal resistance of a sleeping pad. The higher the R-Value the more the sleeping pad is capable to keep you warm during cold nights. For summer and late spring / early autumn I would opt for a sleeping pad with an R-value between 2.0-3.0 depending on the location. For winter camping I would rather go for a sleeping pad with an R-Value of around 5 or more. I have a sleeping pad with an R-value of 3.3 which I have tested at around 0 degree Celsius during the night and I felt the cold. I guess that a sleeping pad with a R-value of around 4 would have been more suitable for this temperature.

---

## Air and hand pumps / Inflators for sleeping pads.
Some sleeping pad manufacturers also selling <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePyKA0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">air pumps</a> for their sleeping pads. Inflating your sleeping pad with an air pump is the most convenient way but adds to the weight of your backpack depending if you use a mechanical air pump or a plastic pump sack.

---

## What are the alternatives to sleeping pads?
If you are looking for an alternative to your sleeping pad then you could either collect a lot of moss or use any gear which you are carrying with you and could server as a sleeping pad. Just be aware that the insulation might be not that efficient than with a regular sleeping pad. You should probably test such alternatives in your backyard before heading to more remote places.

---

## What are the best brands / manufacturers offering sleeping pads?
There are several brands designing sleeping pads. Some examples are:

* ALPS Mountaineering
* Big Agnes
* Eureka
* Exped
* NEMO Equipment Inc.
* Sea To Summit
* Therm-A-Rest
* Vaude

---

## Which dimensions should a sleeping pad have?
Before you decide on buying a sleeping pad you should measure the dimensions of e.g. you tent. Some sleeping pads are different in their width and length and you may not be able to fit your sleeping pad into your tent. Also make sure that your sleeping pad is long enough.

---

## How durable are sleeping pads?
The durability of a sleeping pad depends on how you treat your pad and how often you use it. The durability can be different for every brand and model. Ultralight sleeping pads wear off much faster than regular sleeping pads since they are made of thinner and lighter materials.

---

## How about sleeping pads filled with down?
Winter sleeping pads like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eKqfYC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Exped Down Mat</a> are sometimes filled with down or covered with a thermal foil layer to increase the insulation.

---

## Using a dry or stuff sack to pack your sleeping pad.
To keep your sleeping pad dry you can stuff it into a <a href="http://amzn.to/2e9rYoJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dry sack</a>. There is usually also a dry sack included when you buy a sleeping pad.

---

## When should I use a foam sleeping pad?
If you want to be on the safe side then you should buy a sleeping pad which is made of foam as it can not get any punctures. They might be less cosy to sleep on so you might look for a soft camping ground. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2f6jZhm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Therm-a-Rest Lite SOL</a> is a popular foam sleeping pad.

---

## Which sleeping pad should I use as a side sleeper?
If you are a side sleeper or turn around while sleeping then you should probably get a wider sleeping pad. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2f6jB2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Therm-a-Rest NeoAirs</a> are popular sleeping pads.

---

## Is there any difference between hiking and camping sleeping pads?
When comparing hiking sleeping pads vs camping sleeping pads then you could select a lighter sleeping pad when you are hiking and a more comfortable and probably heavier one when you only plan to go camping.

---

## Are there sleeping pads for babies?
Some manufacturers also offer sleeping pads for kids but you can also just use a regular sized sleeping pad.

---

## Why is it important that my sleeping pad has grip?
Some sleeping pads have less grip than others which may cause them to slip around in the tent more than other pads.

---

## Are there Repair glue / Repair kit / Patch kit for sleeping pads?
Most sleeping pads come with a repair kit (or patch kit) which includes a repair glue. You can also <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePywc4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">purchase</a> them separately.

---

## Can I use a sleeping pad in a hammock?
You can use your sleeping pad also in a hammock to increase insulation.

---

## How is the insulation (r-value) of sleeping pads?
The r-value indicates the insulation of a sleeping pad. Down or a thermal foil can also add to the insulation and are usually found on winter sleeping pads.

---

## Are there lightweight sleeping pads?
Sleeping pads should be lightweight if you are planning to go on a hiking trip. I found the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePxCMY" rel="nofollow">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a> a good compromise between insulation and weight.

---

## What is the best length and width of sleeping pads?
Sleeping pads come in different length and width. Choose the one which comes closer to your length. Choose a wide sleeping pad if you move around while sleeping or if you are a big person.

---

## What should I do if my sleeping pad leaks?
If your sleeping pad is leaking because you got a puncture then you should fix it with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePywc4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">valve repair kids</a> or buy a new sleeping pad.

---

## What materials are used to make sleeping pads?
Sleeping pads are usually made of foam or plastic.

---

## Memory foam
Some sleeping pads are made of memory foam which moulds to a warm body.

---

## What are the most comfortable sleeping pads?
The most comfortable sleeping pad is usually more heavy and thicker. Also here it depends on your needs. A sleeping pad can be super comfortable but it may be a trade off if you have to carry your heavy and comfortable sleeping pad the whole day.

---

## What are non inflatable sleeping pads?
Non-inflatable sleeping pads are the safest pads for back-country adventures. They can't get any puncture but they are not as comfortable as inflatable pads.

---

## Are sleeping pads noisy?
Some sleeping pads may be more noisy to sleep on especially if they have an insulation foil as a thermal layer. A good solution towards noisy sleeping pads are ear plugs.

---

## How should I attach my sleeping pad on a backpack?
A sleeping pad can be attached on the backpack. A good spot is either on the side or on the top of the backpack.

---

## Should I use a sheet on my sleeping pad?
If you prefer to have your sleeping pad like your bed at home then you could cover your sleeping pad with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2dIDYgh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Therm-a-Rest Universal Sheet</a>.

---

## Are self inflating sleeping pads better than air or foam pads?
Self-inflating sleeping pads like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eQVykm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Therm-a-Rest Evolite</a> have a special foam which do not require you to inflate the pad yourself. One disadvantage of a self-inflating sleeping pad is the additional weight which comes with such a foam.

---

## Which sleeping pad should I buy if I am a side sleeper?
If you are a side sleeper then you should look out for a wider sleeping pad like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePxCMY" rel="nofollow">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a>.

---

## How should I store my sleeping pad?
On the trail you can store your sleeping pad in a stuff sack. Usually, I just use the stuff sack to store my sleeping pad at home.

---

## How thick should a sleeping pad be?
The thickness of a sleeping pad is also (but not only) an indication on how well a pad insulates.

---

## What types of sleeping pads are available?
There are three types of sleeping pads available: self-inflating foam-and-air, inflatable and closed-cell foam pads.

---

## What are the temperature ratings of sleeping pads?
The temperature rating of a sleeping pad depends on the thickness, filling, insulation foil or foam of a pad and is usually indicated by the r-value.

---

## What are ultralight sleeping pads?
Some brands offer ultralight sleeping pads. Their size is probably optimized or they use lighter materials. My favourite ultralight 4-season sleeping pad is the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePxCMY" rel="nofollow">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a>.

---

## Sleeping pad vs inflatable air mattress
A foam sleeping pad might be less comfortable and bulky than a air mattress however a foam mattress is a safer option agains punctures compared to an air mattress.

---

## Are there valve replacement or valve repair for sleeping pads?
Some sleeping pad manufacturers offer <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePywc4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">valve repair kids</a> which you can purchase additionally.

---

## Should I take a sleeping pad pillow on my hiking trip?
Some manufacturers are also selling <a href="http://amzn.to/2e9qV8p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inflatable air pillows</a>. You can also use spare clothes as an alternative to an air pillow.  

---

## What are the best winter sleeping pads?
Winter sleeping pads are usually thicker and have a special insulation like down or a foil which increases their r-value. One of my favourite winter sleeping pads is the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePxCMY" rel="nofollow">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a>.

---

## Is there a weight limit for sleeping pads?
There is no weight limit on sleeping pads. You have to decide yourself how much comfort you want and if it's worth to carry it.

---

## Conclusion
So which is the best sleeping pad for 2017? I found my Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm more comfortable than my EXPED SYNMAT UL 7 M and it insulates more while being lighter. I found the Therm-a-rest more comfortable because of it's surface pattern. I just don't get along with those vertically grooves on the EXPED. I also found that the Therm-a-rest is more stable to sleep on. Having said that, it's still possible to sleep on the EXPED depending on your own preference. Below the surface of the EXPED Synmat UL 7 M compared to the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm.

However, the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm is a bit more expensive than the SYNMAT UL 7 M. What I like on the SYNMAT is that it is easy to inflate and deflate. For the Therm-a-rest it took me a little bit longer because of the smaller valve compared to the EXPED. Since I found the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm a reference model for cold temperatures, I didn't include any other sleeping pads which are more heavy except the Therm-a-Rest EvoLite since it is a self-inflating pad for the warmer months. If I would go on a trip then my preference would go towards the Therm-a-rest XTherm - which is the best sleeping pad in my opinion. In very cold conditions I would combine the Therm-a-Rest XTherm with the Therm-a-Rest Z Sol. I hope you that this article helps you to pick your best sleeping pad in 2017.
