On our hiking and backpacking trips we need a lot of energy to power our USB devices such as our GoPro Hero camera, Suunto Ambit3, iPhones and iPads or headlamps.

For a multi-day trip where we have no access to a power socket we solely rely on a portable USB battery to charge our devices.

We are also lately experimenting with a solar panel and we will publish our findings on our blog latest by the end of the year.

Previously, we have used the Astro E3 10000mAh for our trips which worked quite well for 4-5 day trips. However, on our trip to the [Sarek National Park][1] in Sweden we realised that 10000mAh is not sufficient for longer trips exceeding 4-5 days (depending on how much gear you have to charge).

As we are planning a more extensive trip this year we had a look on a USB battery which has even more capacity at a similar weight and size of our old Anker Astro E3.

After doing some research online I came across the Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 with a capacity of 16000mAh - 6000mAh more juice than the Anker Astro E3.

There were also some similar products available but after reading reviews and comments some of them didn't deliver the capacity which they were advertised with.

## Weight
The Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh weights about 296 grams while our old Astro E3 10000mAh weights about 245 grams - an increase of weight by only 66 grams. While the Astro E3 weights about 0.0245 grams/mAh we can see a decrease to  0.0185 grams/mAh on the 2nd Gen Astro E5.

## Size
The Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 comes at a size of 150 × 62 × 22mm while our old Astro E3 comes with 142 x 72 x 16mm.

## Output
The Astro E3 outputs 5V / 2A and USB 5V / 1 A - depending on the device. You also have to make sure to connect the right device to the right USB socket while the new Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 can automatically detect the device connected on one of the 2 USB sockets (the company calls this technology PowerIQ).

There are also 4 LEDs on the the device which indicating the battery status. The battery can be charged with the included USB cable e.g. on a computer or on a power socket if you have a USB adapter.

We have tested the Anker Astro E5 on our trips in Sweden and Finland and we are very happy with it as battery pack which is worth taking to your adventures.
