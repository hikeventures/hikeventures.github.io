Do you need a new down jacket for the winter or for a cold summer night during a hike? Here is our buying guide[^1] of the best summer and winter down jackets which we have selected for 2016. We have selected a broad range of down jackets which can be worn in different conditions and for different activities like hiking, backpacking, skiing, snowboarding, mountaineering, climbing or any other backcountry outdoor adventure.

We have been hiking, packrafting and snowshoeing in Scandinavia, Russia and Continental Europe (read our [trip reports][1]) and even so we are not able to test every product, we follow the market and compare the specifications of new products. Here comes our buying guide[^1].

The down jackets we have selected are sorted by weight and we have just selected goose down jackets with a fill power of 800 and more since they offer the best warmth-weight ratio and are considered to be lightweight down jackets. We have included down jackets which you can use as a 3-season down jacket as well as winter down jackets. The lighter jackets usually come with less down and are more suitable for warmer months or as a mid-layer during the winter.

Sometimes you might also get a down jacket for a significant lower price especially at the end of the season when stores want to clear their stock. In many cases the new models just come with a different color so it's worth to have a look on the old models as well. <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/deals/" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find discounts and compare prices of different stores in the U.S.

The Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer Hooded Down Jacket is one of the lightest down jackets available. This is a great jacket for camping during spring, summer and autumn or as a light mid-layer for the winter. If you are looking for a proper winter jacket then we would rather pick the Rab Infinity Endurance or the Rab Positron jacket. For a stylish jacket to use during winter mainly in town we would go for the Arcteryx Ceres jacket.

# FAQ on Down Jackets

## When not to wear a down jacket?

You should avoid wearing your down-jacket while you are active (e.g. hiking, biking, climbing or skiing) since down insulates less when it gets wet. So ideally you wear a [fleece jacket][17] when you are active and switch to your down jacket when you are resting.

## What is down quality?

A high down quality indicates that less down is needed to keep you warm for the same weight (e.g. a fill power of 900 keeps you more warm than a fill power of 700 with the same amount of down) - having higher warmth-to-weight ratio. A down jacket with the highest fill power and the lightest shell fabric can be considered an ultralight down jacket. Fill power is measured by cuin. A ratio of 90:10 expresses the down-feather ratio (90% down and 10% feathers).

## Are down jackets waterproof?

The shell of your down jacket is slightly water repellent in order to keep the down dry in case you get into very light rain. If you expect to get more rain, swap the down jacket with a [fleece jacket][19] and pull on a [rain jacket][20]. So in general, down jackets are not waterproof.

---

## How are down jackets designed?

The baffles of a down jacket keep the down in place. There are two possibilities to create those baffles:

* Stitch-through baffles (stitches are the areas where cold can come through the jacket)
* Box wall baffles (better option as there are no areas on the jacket which are not filled with down as opposed to the stitch-through design).

---

## Should a down jacket have a hood?

We would go for a hooded down jacket, as you can use the hood also in your sleeping bag if temperatures drop below of what your sleeping bag is capable to handle.

---

## What is the difference in traditional and hydrophobic down (or HydroDown)?

Hydrophobic down does not absorb water that quickly as traditional down. A hydrophobic down jacket keeps its insulation longer than a traditional down jacket if it gets wet.

---

## Down jackets compared to synthetic filled jackets

Synthetic filled jackets keep you dry even so when they are wet. Disadvantages of a synthetic filled jacket is it's shorter life and it takes more space to pack it in the backpack. It also weights more to deliver the same amount of warmth compared to a down filled jacket. Down is more durable than synthetic fill, more breathable, windproof but also dries slower. A wet down jacket also weights more than a wet synthetic jacket since it absorbs more water. Usually, we carry our down jacket and sleeping bag in a waterproof stuff sack if we don't need them.

---

## Which design features are important on a down jacket?

To keep the warmth inside your jacket, a waist drawstring and wrist closures (e.g. Velcro) are important features. Pockets and a hood are useful as well. The hood should be sewed to the jacket if you want to get maximum warmth. Less pockets and zippers on a down jacket can also reduce weight.

---

## Which fabric shell should be used on a lightweight down jacket?

Many new down jackets feature nowadays a light ripstop shell to make the down jacket a bit resistant against moisture. One disadvantage of those light ripstop shells is that they are not very durable and if it starts raining your down jacket will still soak up water. However, we found them to be sufficient as we usually only wear a down jacket to walk around in camp or as an additional layer in my sleeping bag. So in general, we don't find it important to have a waterproof down jacket which would also lower the breathability of the down jacket.

## Should a down jacket have a hood?

---

## How to clean a down jacket?

The best way to clean a down jacket is to wash it inside out in a washing machine with very low speed. As washing liquid we always use Nikwax Downwash and sometimes additionally Nikwax Downproof to make the down a bit more resistant against moisture.

Hydrophobic down does not absorb water that quickly as traditional down. A hydrophobic down jacket keeps its insulation longer than a traditional down jacket if it gets wet.
