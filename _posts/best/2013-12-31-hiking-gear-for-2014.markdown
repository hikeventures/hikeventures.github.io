Are you planning to buy new gear for your next hiking adventure in 2014? Here is a list of gear I am using or which I am planning to purchase in 2014. When I purchase gear, I usually look into functionality/technology, design and weight.

<h2>Backpack</h2>
I am going to keep my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hmg-porter-4400-black/" target="_self">HMG Porter 4400</a>. This pack is awesome for packrafting as well.

<h2>Tent</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/" target="_self">Hilleberg Anjan 2</a> for trips with 2 person but I am also interested in the <a href="http://www.hilleberg.com/home/products/soulo/soulo.php" target="_blank">Hilleberg Soulo</a> for solo trips.

<h2>Hiking pants</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-arcteryx-palisade-pants/" target="_self">Arcteryx Palisade Pants</a>. They are light and dry fast.

<h2>Hiking T-shirt</h2>
Currently, I am using an Adidas Climalite T-shirt. I might consider an option from Arcteryx in the future. However, I am trying to avoid shirts which have some sort of chemical anti-odor substances on them.

<h2>Rain jacket</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/arcteryx-tecto-fl-jacket/" target="_self">Arcteryx Tecto FL jacket</a> with Gore-Tex Active Shell.

<h2>Hiking boots</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-inov-8-roclite-295/" target="_self">Inov-8 Roclite 295</a> worked quite well. I might also look into Salomon shoes in 2014 e.g. the S-LAB FELLCROSS 2. Boots don't need to be waterproof.

<h2>Sleeping Mattress</h2>
<a href="http://www.exped.com/finland/en/product-category/mats/downmat-ul-7-m" target="_blank">Exped SynMat UL 7</a>

<h2>Sleeping Bag</h2>
<a href="http://sleepingbags-cumulus.eu/uk/categories/sleeping-bags/panyam-450?gid=59&vid=1" target="_blank">Cumulus Panyam 450</a>. Cumulus is a Polish manufacturer and the quality of their products is superb.

<h2>Wind jacket</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-arcteryx-squamish-hoody/" target="_self">Arcteryx Squamish Hoody</a>. I love it!

<h2>Trekking Poles</h2>
I will stick with my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-black-diamond-ultra-distance-z-pole/" target="_blank">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles</a>. They pack small and are light.

<h2>Water Filter</h2>
I am happy with my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-katadyn-mini-water-filter/" target="_self">Katadyn Mini</a> filter. It's light and the water taste natural.

<h2>Stove</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-jetboil-sol-ti/" target="_blank">Jetboil Sol Ti</a>.

<h2>Headlamp</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/petzl-nao-headlamp-test/" target="_blank">Petzl Nao</a> works very well. Might be a bit too heavy for some hikers but I like the option to charge it with my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/how-to-charge-your-batteries-when-you-are-outdoors/" target="_blank">Anker Astro 3E</a> battery.

<h2>GPS</h2>
<a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-suunto-ambit-2-black-hr/" target="_blank">Suunto Ambit 2</a>. It's simply the best device for me and can be charged as well with an external battery on the trail. I might also be in the market for a <a href="http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=100" target="_blank">Spot Gen3</a> in 2014. When we went hiking in Sarek this year we had no mobile phone signal in case of emergency need. The issue with the <a href="http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=100" target="_blank">Spot Gen3</a> is however the yearly subscription fee of 99 USD.

<h2>Down Jacket for warmer months</h2>
I will keep my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-montbell-u-dot-l-down-parka/" target="_blank">Montbell U.L Down Parka</a>. There might be also other options like the <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-ghost-whisperer-hooded-jacket-OM5271.html" target="_blank">Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer Hooded Down Jacket</a> which has more down fill power.

<h2>Down jacket for winter</h2>
For the winter, a hydro-down jacket or a jacket with a coreloft/down would be interesting e.g. <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=Mens&model=Cerium-LT-Hoody" target="_blank">Arcteryx Cerium LT Hoody</a>, <a href="http://store.berghaus.com/p/clothing/mens-ilam-850-fill-hydrodown-jacket/420589" target="_blank">Berghaus IIam</a> or <a href="http://store.berghaus.com/p/mens/mens-ramche-850-fill-hydrodown-jacket/420588" target="_blank">Ramche</a> or <a href="http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/down/neutrino-endurance-jacket.html" target="_blank">Rab Neutrino Endurance Jacket</a>.

<h2>Fleece</h2>
If am doing activities, I will rather use a fleece than a down jacket. Currently, I am using a Hagl√∂fs Micro Top fleece which is quite light. However, it would be easier to put the fleece on/off if it would have a full zip. My current option for 2014 might be an <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=Mens&model=Delta-LT-Jacket" target="_blank">Arcteryx Delta LT jacket</a>.

<h2>Socks</h2>
I will keep my Smartwool PhD Outdoor Light Mini. They dry reasonably fast on the trail and keep my feet warm if wet.

<h2>Underwear</h2>
Icebreaker Anatomica Brief

<h2>Water bottle</h2>
Any simple water bottle will do it in 2014

<h2>Accessoires</h2>
Petzl Attache 3D for attaching stuff on the backpack while packrafting or hiking. <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-ortlieb-document-case-a4/" target="_self">Ortlieb Document bag</a> to keep maps dry. <a href="http://hikeventures.com/field-notes-expedition-and-space-pen/" target="_self">Field notes and space pen</a> to document the trip. Light my fire Swedish Steel as emergency matches and my Victorinox Swisslite pocket knife which is small and light.
