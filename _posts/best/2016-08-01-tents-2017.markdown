For 2017 - 2018 we can expect to see plenty of new backpacking tents on the market.

The trend clearly goes towards lightweight tents.

However, are lightweight tents always the best option? It depends.

Ultralight gear is sometimes made of materials which are not very durable.

However, if you plan to only go occasionally on outdoor trips or if you are into ultralight backpacking then buying an ultralight tent might be a better option even so you may compromise with the durability of the tent.

Further, you may also have a look on which [sleeping pads](http://www.hikeventures.com/sleeping-pads-2017/) I would consider to pack into my backpack.

Our <a rel="nofollow" href="#list">selection</a> below contains only new / updated tents and I might add a few more later on.

<hr>

So which tent should you choose? It's definitely a hard question as there are many high quality tents out there. Do you need a winter tent or a 3-season tent? Idealy, you should buy a dedicated tent for different seasons or purposes to get your new tent for 2017. For example on our [hiking and packrafting trip in Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/finland-norway/) I have only used a lightweight 3-season tent which I received for testing from a company. I was not that happy with the durability of the inner mesh tent but on the other hand I did not have to carry that much weight and enjoyed my trip.
