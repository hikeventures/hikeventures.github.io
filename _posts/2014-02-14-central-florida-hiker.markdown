Central Florida Hiker was started in 2013 as a way for me to share my adventures as well as information on the hiking in Central Florida. When people think of Florida they immediately think of the beach. My goal is to get people excited about all of the hiking and camping opportunities we have in Florida that are often overlooked.

My background:

I spent my childhood camping across Florida with the Boy Scouts of America. I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, which is the highest rank in the Boy Scout program. I have carried that love of the outdoors through the rest of my life. 

I now live in Orlando where I get outdoors as much as possible. My trips include many state parks, local forests, as well as hiking on the Florida Trail. I also kayak and canoe on the local rivers in Central Florida. During the day I work as a Digital Project Manager. The skills I use in my day job help me while working on the CentralFloridaHiker.com.

Follow along

If youâ€™re interested in hiking and camping I welcome you to follow me! My posts on <a href="http://www.centralfloridahiker.com" target="_blank">CentralFloridaHiker.com</a> include information not just on Florida specific topics, but also gear reviews, advice and photos. 

In addition to camping in Florida, I travel to other parts of the county as often as possible. I have recently backpacked along the Chattooga River, hiked a portion of the AT in Grayson Highlands State Park, and hiked to the top of Crowder Mountain in South Carolina.

Thank you for the opportunity to tell your audience about my blog. 

I hope everyone gets out and enjoys the outdoors. 

Have fun out there!
