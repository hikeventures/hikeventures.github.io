<a href="http://www.howlingmist.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Howlingmist.blogsport.com</a> is a blog I started a few years ago to catalogue my activities.  It is still just a personal diary but I hope some of the things I do and places I visit might be of some interest.

A list of places I have visited so far range from the pyrenees and Alps to the Highlands of Scotland and the best that Ireland has to offer.

From my faltering attempts at hill running to mountaineering in the Alps perhaps you will find something to enjoy within.
