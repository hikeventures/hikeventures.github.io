A couple of months ago, I was looking for a new tent which I can use during my planned hikes in Sweden and Finland and for other backpacking, packrafting and camping trips.  After some field testing I am now able to write a short review about my experiences with the Hilleberg Anjan 2 which I found to be one of the best 3-season tunnel tents.

## Features
The Hilleberg Anjan 2 comes with 1700 grams, a big window for ventilation, reflectors, 2 mosquito windows and 12 Tri-Pegs. I found the quality and craftmanship of the Anjan 2 quite excellent. The outer tent can also be used as a standalone tent. The inner height is 100 cm and the inner tent area 2.8 m2.

Big windows for superb air-circulation!

It is possible to use the tent either as a shelter (without the inner tent) or just the inner tent in case there is no rain expected during the warm summer nights.

However, one drawback of the Anjan 2 is that it seems to condensate inside quite a bit if I keep the tent completely closed for a longer period while it is raining. Also the tent should be pitched on grass as rain can get into the tent if pitched on hard ground.

The tent has also reflective stripes so you can find it if it's too dark.

Plenty of storage room for gear. The GT model of this tent has even more storage capacity.

The Hilleberg Anjan 3 compared to Mountain Equipment AR Ultralite 2. The Hilleberg is just slightly bigger and 200 grams heavier but you will enjoy plenty of more space.

The Hilleberg Anjan 3 is a good choice if you are big or if you just want to have more room in the tent to store gear inside of the tent or just to play some cards if it's raining outside.

## Recommendation
The Hilleberg Anjan tent seems to be the perfect 3 season tent. It is easy to set up, costs a little less than it's 4 season brothers and weights 1 kg less too. The tent might be a bit narrow inside if your are big/tall and you  should consider to take a 3 person rather than a 2 person tent if you are planning to camp with your friend. I would highly recommended for backpacking trips where you need to save weight during the warmer months of the year. Overall I would recommend the Anjan 3 for 2 person rather than Anjan 2. The Anjan 3 has slightly more weight but you will appreciate the additional space. If you need a lightweight 4-season tent then you should have a look at the <a href="http://amzn.to/1QW9M13">Hilleberg Nallo</a>.

In the picture below you can see Konstantin preparing his packraft on our one week <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/">trip</a> in Northern Sweden. In our backpack we also had our Hilleberg Anjan with us. There are as good as no shelters and having a reliable tent was a must for us. The Anjan did quite well!
