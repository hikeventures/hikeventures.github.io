description: Looking for better sound quality for your DSLR Video? Consider the Zoom H5

Having used my Sony A7r for over 1 year (but recently sold) I am planning to get better sound on my Videos once I get my new camera. The onboard microphone is more or less useless when filming in a windy place and in general you get better audio with an external microphone.

First of all it was important to know which type of microphone I would need. The <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs">Zoom H5</a> comes with an X/Y microphone which seems to be a good microphone to record the environment but also towards a certain direction. For a more focused recording (e.g. if you want to record a bird in the distance), a shotgun microphone would be even better and I might consider buying a <a href="http://amzn.to/14jumU0">Sennheiser MKE 600</a> in the future as well.

## Features
After doing some research online, I decided to buy the Zoom H5 for the following reasons:

* Shock mounted X/Y microphone structure which minimises external vibration noise
* Possible to connect it to your DSLR and record on both - the H5 and the DSLR (for a backup)
* The recorder can be mounted on a tripod and placed nearby the sound source
* Input signal to the DSLR can be adjusted
* Possibility to connect several Microphones e.g. a combination of wired and wireless microphone
* Comes with free audio editing software from Cubase and Steinberg
* Size and wight are ok
* Offers Phantom Power to external microphones
* 2 AA batteries needed but can also be powered via USB by using an external battery like the <a href="http://amzn.to/1slxquk">Anker Astro 3</a><br><br>

## Weight

* 276 grams for the <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs">Zoom H5</a> including X/Y microphone & excluding 2 x AA batteries
* 47 grams for 2 AA batteries
* 42 grams for the USB cable
* 311 grams for the <a href="http://amzn.to/1wKEtsW">SLIK Mini Pro III</a>
* 248 grams for the 10.000 mAh Anker Astro 3 battery (there is a <a href="http://amzn.to/1slxquk">newer model</a> available which comes with 12.800 mAh).

On my trips I always have my <a href="http://amzn.to/1slxquk" rel="nofollow">Anker battery</a> with me which I use to charge my other devices e.g. <a href="http://hikeventures.com/petzl-nao-headlamp-test/">Petzl Nao</a>, <a href="http://hikeventures.com/suunto-ambit3-ambit2-worth-upgrade/">Suunto Ambit3</a> or my DSLR. Therefore, the 2 AA batteries are not really needed and I can save some weight here. Also I will the the <a href="http://amzn.to/1y2BLVy" rel="nofollow">APH-5</a> extension pack for the <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs" rel="nofollow">Zoom H5</a> next week which comes with a wind shield and a remote control for the H5.

I will most likely test the <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs" rel="nofollow">Zoom H5</a> on our trip to Lapland which we have planned by end of January. Let's see how it performs (also considering the cold temperatures there at the moment -30C) and I hope that I am able to provide great audio on our videos in the future.
