Winter time - freezing time! Or not? I have tested the Arcteryx Kappa Pants and here is a short review. I have tested the Kappa pants here in Finland at -21 °C and found them comfortable warm wearing merino pants under it. At around -10 °C I just skipped Merino. This are probably the best winter pants from my point of view. The Arcteryx Kappa Pants are soft-shell pants and made for active winter use like snowshoeing, winter hiking, skiing or snowboarding. If you plan to stay outside e.g. for winter camping I would rather recommend down pants. However, for my <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/" target="_self">snowshoeing activities</a>  in Finnish Lapland they have worked great and are currently my favourite outdoor pants for winter activities.<br><br>

## Features
The Arcteryx Kappa pants are 600 grams light, moisture-resistand and windproof. They are also comfortable to wear and their insulation consists of Coreloft. The side-zippers make it easy to put-on/off the pants and the adjustable webbing belt saves weight to a conventional belt as well. The quality of the Kappa Pants is also on the high-end side but you have to pay for it of course.

## Recommendation
The Arcteryx Kappa Pants should also work great for skiing or snowboarding. Concerning the size, I have ordered M and I am 180 cm tall. I can recommend this pants as long as temperatures are below 0 °C as they are quite warm.
