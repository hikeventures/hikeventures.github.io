After a chilly night in our tent which we pitched on a small island we woke up still a little bit exhausted from the [previous day][1] and prepared some breakfast. While the fog was gone there were still a few clouds in the sky but the weather looked promising.

After crawling out of the tent we explored our little island.

Small bushes and mushrooms covered our island.

But there were probably not enough mushrooms to prepare a proper meal.

It was time to pack our backpacks and to leave the island. Our goal was to reach our starting point - the STF Turiststation Abisko - by noon.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23584012281/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/727/23584012281_dd8ef2e307_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Since Patrick lost his PFD the previous day he decided to paddle along the shore while Konstantin explored some rocks which poked out in the middle of the Torneträsk lake. It would have been quite a long swim to the shore if Konstantin would have faced any issues with his packraft. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640378186/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/692/23640378186_a7379633bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The landscape was just fantastic. I think the clouds made the whole area look even more impressive than a completly blue sky.

After a few hours of paddling we decided to get out of our packrafts and to continue our trip on the land. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23557902422/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/614/23557902422_6a5fe3c0e7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

During our hike we also met a few hikers which also indicated that we were already close to our starting point.

The trail was quite good and the area around the Torneträsk lake seems to be also a popular place for bird watching.

Another fantastic view towards the Torneträsk lake.

Who wouldn’t like to go hiking and packrafting here?

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23557883602/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/630/23557883602_ed77e52e53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At 2 pm we arrived at the STF Turiststation Abisko and we went straight to the Restaurant. On the picture Patrick is pointing to the location where we were paddling. 

The food was actually quite good and affordable (dinner however was quite expensive and we decided to skip it). There was a small shop in the hostel where we bought some snacks. I am not sure why the dinner is that pricey there … probably they are focusing more on quality tourists rather than the average backpacker. However, if you don’t want to camp there is a possibility to get an affordable shared room or a more pricey “hotel” room. We decided to stay one night in the shared room since Patrick got a flu on the last day of the trip.

The finish line of the Fjällräven Classic. In a way we could say that we have been the first who arrived at the finish line of the Fjällräven Classic 2015 :)

The Trekkers Inn where you could get drinks and snacks after finishing the Fjällräven Classic. There was also the Ultra Run at the same time for those who prefer to run the 110 km.

After having had our lunch we unpacked our backpacks to have our gear dried.

The next day we went to Kiruna with the train - where Fjällräven had his registration point for the Fjällräven Classic participants. More about Fjällräven Classic 2015 soon on our blog. In the meantime you can read about Konstantin’s trip to the [Scottish Highlands][2].
