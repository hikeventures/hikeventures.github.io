Having a GoPro camera is great. With all the multitude of various mounts and cases, you have seemingly endless possibilities to mix and match these ingredients to achieve a perfect combination that  suits your current filming conditions best. <br><br>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15952674596" title="Thule Perspektiv action camera bag"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7490/15952674596_d347bf8586_o.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Thule Perspektiv action camera bag"></a><!--more--><br><br>

But having all those choices comes with some downsides as well, one of them being a constant challenge to keep all those parts together and not endlessly search for them in the deepest recesses of your pack. In the past I have tried to solve this problem by designating a separate 'electronics' pouch which helped me to keep everything on one place. But as it was soft, I often ended up with the empty battery and hours of the footage of the pouch's insides. <br><br>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15792440089" title="Thule Perspektiv action camera bag"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7506/15792440089_4f916edd4d_o.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Thule Perspektiv action camera bag"></a><br><br>

To solve this problem, I started to take out the battery and keep it separately. But this has caused a problem of its own - whenever I wanted to use my GoPro, I had to spend a few minutes tinkering with the case and trying to figure out which side the battery should go in. And on a number of occasions this has resulted in missed opportunities. So, is there a working solution then?

The designers of this bag have definitely taken the needs of the user into consideration. Because this case is divided into two separate parts: the top soft compartment with the rolldown closure and the bottom hard case with padded inside.
