When you are new into hiking and backpacking then you might come up with the question where to store your money and credit cards while on the trail?

Sometimes - especially when you are new into hiking and backacking - you don't really think that much about your wallet. However, when you get  more experience and plan to cut some weight on your gear then you will realize that even changing your wallet can make a difference in weight and functionality.

But not only weight is an essent important factor when considering which wallet to choose. In some countries there is no need to have cash with you e.g. in Finland you can pay in most places with a card. Maybe there are some exceptions where you still need some cash with you. In countries where you can pay mostly with cards you can even take a smaller wallet with you like the Fjällräven Zip Card Wallet Holder.

However, if you still prefer to have notes and coins with you then there is also the Fjällräven Zip Wallet which is a  bit bigger than the Fjällräven Zip Card Holder and has more compartments to store yourcards and money.

Both wallets are made of G-1000 fabric - a synthetic / cotton mixture which Fjällräven also uses on it's clothes.

However, there is also an inexpensive alternative to those wallets (G-1000 is not waterproof if you don't wax it) - which is a simple plastic bag where your store your money while on the trail. This is probably an even safer option to keep your notes and cards dry.

However, as an alternative - which is also more fashionable - I prefer the Fjällräven wallets. They are a bit pricey but they come in different colors and just look nice. If you have a small phone like the iPhone 4S or the iPhone SE then you can even store the phone inside the Fjällräven Zip wallet (it's not an official feature but it works).

##  Conclusion
If you are only interested in functionality then go for a cheap plastic bag. If you are also into fashion and want to use your wallet  also  as your regular wallet in the city then I would recommend one of the Fjällräven wallets. To make them 100% waterproof you might however still place it in some sort of plastic bag.
