## River walking
Exciting. Always something to do. But too low water levels and getting too much. A great river to paddle especially if more water. Never boating and nor changed much by men. At least not that visible.

## The flood and remainings
The damaged bridges, the castle, part of the road, the caravan park - on the way it looked like on the grensmaas. Lots of rubbish. On the way back, story from the guy, contamination with kerosine, the stationary trailer destroyed against the bridge. Furniture, contorted bikes, bedding, clothes, a small Scottish St. Andrew's flag, hanging on a tree. Trees. Lots of firewood. But also a few strainers. Passing by one of the sides, high undercut shore, fallen trees and the sound of slipping and falling rocks. Some trees overhanging and will follow soon.

The water contaminated. And lots of sharp / metal objects in the water. Seen some signs or parts of metal sidings with jarred edges on the bottom, or sometimes pressed against the rocks. Paddle, be careful and don't think too much - self fulfilling prophecy.

## Tea Time in Ballater
In Ballater stepped out after the bridge to get some food. The one with the trailer - and went to Dreeside garage. Got tea and chocolate. Asked if there was anywhere to eat. Well, the town centre had all been flooded. Were they too? Yes. They got the water, but from the village, not directly from the river. When did it happen? On the 30th of December. Merry Christmas and a happy new year. in a way yes, he smiled bitterly. Got back.  

Had tea with Patrick and then asked a passerby of there was a shop. We saw it, but I was not sure if it was open. Yes, behind the church. Just follow the main road. On the way, the shops closed. The Royal appointment for this or for that. Closed, the floor boards ripped off, heaters and fens staring there to dry the aftermath of the flood.
For more than 100 years not like that. People have already forgotten that it can be like that. And they got careless. But the nature reminds us of its might from time to time.

## Getting food in Ballater
Wales to the shop warring my dry suit. Strange, but comfortable. I was not there to impress people, but to get the food. No one asked me any questions, I didn't give any one any explanations.
