If you want to buy a hat - an outdoor hat - are there any things that you need to pay attention to.

Of course, like every booth and product in this show it depends on your needs. So if you're a paddler and you're on the water all day long even
though I love this cap if I'm paddling.

I'm not going for 10 ounce canvas I'm gonna go for some of this synthetic item which has fantastic breathability, really nice sun protection and it's gonna stay on.

Right, so something just as simple as that based on your needs whether you need something beefy that you can beat the heck out of
it or something that's gonna be maybe a little bit more lightweight and a little better in the water as well.

So identify your needs. You got it.
