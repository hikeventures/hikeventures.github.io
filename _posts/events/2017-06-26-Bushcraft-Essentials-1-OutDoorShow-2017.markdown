This is our fire piston. It is a very ancient way of making fire. It works basically like a diesel engine. It works by air compression.

The principal is you put tinder in here, then put the plunger back into the cylinder, and compress the air a couple of times.

I'm not allowed to show it to you on the ... In the front of the show because they've complained to the fire police.

I'm not allowed to make fire here, so I can just show it in theory. You compress it. Then you have here some ember, which you can put into your nest and then blow and to build up your fire.

This little gadget in here, is a fire steel, which you can use as an alternative way of making fire.

It has a vent so you can put in the plunger again and there is a water tight compartment at the end for your tinder, so to keep your tinder dry.

The fire piston has been used as a method of making fire in middle Europe for a long time, and it is still in use, I believe, in Indonesia, in everyday use.

The Bushcraft essential fire piston.
