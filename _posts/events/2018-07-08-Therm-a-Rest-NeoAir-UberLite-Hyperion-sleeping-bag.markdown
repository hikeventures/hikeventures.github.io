Our absolute highlight for the next year will be the new Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Uberlight which is this mattress here.

It weights just 250 gram, has a thickness of 6.4 centimeters. So it's actually thick enough that you feel comfortable in it.

Thick enough to give you a comfortable sleep and it has an r-value of two so it's the ideal mattress for any summer adventures maybe
three season adventures if it's not getting too cold.

And if you're getting too cold you probably need to bring something extra.

You can always use another thin foam mattress to boost your r-value and your warmth.

So its 250 grams. You can't combine it with a sleeping bag of 450 gram and together these two will be your most lightweight sleeping system on the market.

So all together it will be under 700 gram.

All together it will be under 700 gram. It will be even lighter than a half liter of beer.

That's quite funny. The mattress packs down to an absolute minimum deflated.

That's the packing so you can basically compare it to a can of soda or coke. Wow.

I think kind of soda is slightly bigger. Maybe at least the diameter is definitely.

So but it's really surprising so you can just take it with you and you have absolutely no problem.

I also heard that it's really interesting for people who go on hiking adventures in foreign countries and you have to take into account money that they allowed to take and get on their flight.
