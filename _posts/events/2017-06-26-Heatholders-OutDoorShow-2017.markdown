**Konstantin:**	Hi. This is Konstantin, and I've got James from Heat Holders.

**James:**	Yes.

**Konstantin:**	James, could you tell us something about your brand and product?

**James:**	Yeah, of course. Basically, the Heat Holders, it does what it says on tin. It traps all the warm air close to your skin without making your feet sweat.

The technology is that you got a long looping pile. It goes through an intense brushing process. So what it does, as I said, it traps all the warm air close to your skin without making your feet sweat.

We started off the company in 2008. Since then, we've sold over 20 million pairs of socks worldwide, as far as Australia, New Zealand, all throughout Europe, America, even as far as Chile and Argentina.

**Konstantin:**	Wherever people need to have their feet warm.

**James:**	That's it. Your extremities, your hands, your feet, are always the first place to feel the cold.

And people said to us, "We love your socks, can you make anything else?" This is where we came up with tights, leggings. Yeah, blankets. Even fleeces, snug overs.

Our latest project, here's what we've done, we've actually teamed up with Disney, so we co-branded with Disney. So we've got Superman, Minions, Star Wars, Frozen, it really is, it's loved by millions.

**Konstantin:**	The first time I actually saw your product was this winter when I was in Norway, and I bought it in a shop, for my wife because I thought she usually has cold feet. Not in that way, but ... No pun intended.

But then I realized why wouldn't I try to do it for my packrafting trips. And I just used it about two times, or three times, and I loved it.

**James:**	Yeah. Again, Heat Holders, there's may different uses for it such as fishing, camping, hiking. Even going to watch the soccer. I'm from Leicester originally. So last year, well not last year, the year before, we won the league, as you probably know [crosstalk 00:02:15]. So yeah, it's multi-functional purposes.

**Konstantin:**	But you also have two thicknesses.

**James:**	That's correct. Yes. We do have what we call a TOG. So it's Thermal Overall Grade. It's basically a measurement of warmth. And then also we have 1.6TOG. Which basically, the Heat Holders LITE, it fits into normal shoes. Not everybody has bigger shoes, so to speak. It's been a phenomenal success for us, it really has.

**Konstantin:**	And how to you actually ... so it's tested in a laboratory?

**James:**	Yeah. It's scientifically proven to be seven times warmer than any normal cotton sock. The socks are made in Indonesia. It's made with a special Japanese imported yarn, which we have exclusivity throughout the whole of the world basically, for the socks.
