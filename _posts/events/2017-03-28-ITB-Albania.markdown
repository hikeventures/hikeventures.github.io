**Here I am at Albania's stands with Ardit. He's the General Director of the National Tourism Agency of Albania. Ardit, could you tell us something about the highlights of Albania for outdoors?**

Albania is one of the most important regions, not only country, in Balkan.

To practice outdoor sports, we have more than 30% of all the bio diversity of all Europe in Albania, and you can find in 30 minutes very high mountains and a lot of rivers, lakes, two seas, Adriatic and Ionian seas.

But of course, you can practice a lot of outdoor sports. For example, we have this year The Ninth World Championship Of Paragliding in Vlore, in Albania, where more than 120 countries are coming to be present on this World Championship.

And also you can practice a lot of other beautiful sports, for example rafting or cycling or rally also, so you have just to come not as a visitor but as a guest in Albania and you can find everything for your activities to practice that.

**Thank you very much.**

You're welcome.
