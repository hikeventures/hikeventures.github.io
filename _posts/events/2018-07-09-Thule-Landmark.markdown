So for next summer we have a new collection called Thule landmark which is all about adventure traveling, backpacking in
another words.

Something we really haven't done as a brand before. We have luggage but we've not really done backpacking or adventure traveling.

So this one is basically multi-purpose that you can do a lot of things with.

Absolutely and we have three different sizes here.

We have a 40 liter we have a 60 liter and 70 liter and they are all gender specific.

So we have something for men and we have some for women. So let me start with the 40 liter which is a carry-on product.

So would have made you European airlines for signs of it is absolutely compatible.

What makes it very user friendly for taking on aeroplanes and so forth is what you'll find is with the shoulder straps.

They can tuck away.

All right so you know on so you down and click that and here we serve just to demonstrate here.

I'm going to toggle that away and then with the hip belt same thing it tucks away in here.

So when you go to the airport there's nothing showing,there's nothing getting caught on a conveyor belt and you're not getting told to hide this and hide that.

As you can so you can do it very very well.

PAC system very very comfortable but minimal but padded where it needs to be.

What is very unique to this particular product is this safe zone it's all about protection it's a molded EVA area which we have on
a number of our packs and what we starts it basically provides 360 degrees of protection so I could put glasses in here, I could put my phone in
here, camera and if a bag being thrown around and dropped it's also fully protected.

Another good thing with the actual safe zone is actual protection.

Now if I'm wearing this maybe in the metro or a subway someone could maybe undo the ZIP the very do undo the ZIP and they have to get in between
compartments.

We've added more security pockets in here and also sort of doubles up protection.

As you can see lots of different storage capabilities in there.

So the safe zone is fairly unique two doors as a brand and as I said we have that on a number of products out there.

I think I've seen something on your product like this it was related to the GoPro.

Yeah absolutely.

And we also have it on a range of bags that are on route which we've had for many many years and really is an area we can put your phone or your
glasses so there should always safe zone over to other areas as well.

This is really good.

We put another really good feature on here a little locking mechanism here.

So you can see a picture of a lock on here.

So to make you a little bit of secure when you're wearing it in traveling I will hook these into this area here and this one as well.

So essentially if I'm wearing this and someone wants to get into my safe zone you're going to find it difficult because they can't open it.

Now what I can do to make even more secure is put a padlock through there as well so it's a little
simple thing but it works very very well.

What makes this quite a versatile pack as well is we wanted to create an opening which opens up like a suitcase.

Yep. It almost looks like a duffel bag.

Absolutely so it's very easy to get in and very easy to get out. It's very quick very simple and as you can
see in here you have further pockets as well and are compression straps in here as well to hold it right down.

What's very good about this pack as well for traveling, a lot of people take their laptop, take their tablet when they're traveling so we have a separate laptop and tablet padded area so we'll take a 15 inch laptop a 10 inch tablet in there all fleece-lined all fully protected bumpers in there as well and being this close to the back there.

A little bit more security aspect to it as well and you see a grab hand of the side we can put information for myself as a traveler here and we have a quite a big fellows pocket prefer a storage on the side there.

So you can I think easily put a bottle. Absolutely, a bottle holder on there as well. So it's a great really good little product here
this is a full 2 liter one and you said that this is the middle phone this is the first all of them so the actual middle size is a 60 liter yeah let's just make sure this is a 60 liter 70 liter. That's the 70 liter. okay this is a 60 litre here. Now the sixty litre is essentially a 40 liter but it will come with a daypack will think connects onto here okay.

So the idea would be to lock it in but I could also carry it so I can have 40 liters on the back and the 20 liters on the front. So it really is
the same the main bags are same dimension, the same volume the same as this. It doesn't have the actual laptop sleeve on everything's pretty
much the same bag but now with 60 liters I could have an extra 20 litres which then I can take off add on for further liters. So if I'm traveling back through an airport and maybe this is a bit too big and it is carry on I can separate this and give it
to my partner and we can both take something onboard ourselves as well.

And I also see that everything absolutely yeah absolutely.

And even on this 20 litre one if you look at the back here it's very comfortable, good ventilation here again perforated here with a foam on it. In hotter climate you've got more comfort very well.

Sternum strap which is fully adjustable on there as well. These can be tucked away in here so just tightens everything up when I do connect it on there but a good feature as I said you can connect everything from the front there as well with need be. And this 60 later becomes an 80 litres and then you get up to a 70 liter.

What we're doing now is we're having a 50 liter plus a 20 liter on the front and that is a 70 liter but on the 70 liter we do have an another cover.

It tucks away underneath there but the 70 liter does have this tuck away cover on there as well.

So we have men's we have ladies, we have different colors. All the colors are very commercial. It's very typically in terms of design and style. It is very clean, very understated, they will all have reflective logos so we have a silver logo so some of these samples are incorrect for the black they will be silver.

As you see here you lots of gear loops on her you so can attach things carabiners lots going on here.

But yeah adventure travelers is a new area for us there's going to be a lot of focus on this we move forwards and yeah absolutely there so far so good. It's been a lot of excitement and a lot of people looking at these again that makes sense it's pure that's a great design and yeah we've got some good products.

Should we move to the other one yeah so technically this is 40 litre so we have so we have 40 litre then 40 litre
plus 20 later for the 60 later remember have a 50 litre for the 70 liter so you see here is connected here.
