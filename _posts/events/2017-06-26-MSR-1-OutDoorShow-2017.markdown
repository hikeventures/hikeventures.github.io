**Konstantin:**	Hi this is Konstantin and I have got John from MSR. Hi, would you tell us more about the new wind burner family?

**John:**	Sure. So the wind burner stove technology that we introduced a few years ago it was this original stove, have fuel canisters go on top. If you think about the wind burner stove and all this new product shares it, is that it's not only as a press regulator so it's conforming as the temperature gets lower so you never lose performance, but it's also completely wind proof because the stove connects to the pot in way that the wind that technology is really good but it's really focused around the small pot, making hot water, doing dehydrated meals. We wanted to take that same technology of that wind proof and the pressure regulator and expand it out and do more things with the product.

What we had to do because when you have a stove and a canister and pots on top of it, they start getting really tall and tippy. The only way you can make larger pots work on that stove is to get it to be a low stove.

We took the same technology as what we had on the original wind burner and created this new version of the stove so it's nice and low and stable. That allowed us to create larger pots. We started off with creating a 2.5 liter sauce pot. This is a sauce pot because we wanted to have the feeling of sauce, chili, things like that.

**Konstantin:**	So you can simmer it a little bit ...

**John:**	Exactly. The key of thinking about this is it's no longer just a stove and a different size of amount of water you want to make but it's where just like you would have a new kitchen, that you choose the type of pot for what you're cooking. It's 2.5 liter, it has a ceramic coating so it's non-stick. Then also on the bottom of it, instead of having these heat exchanger vents that grab a lot of heat and are great for boiling water, but they also make the hot spot lines in the bottom of the pot.

**Konstantin:**	That's why you removed them.

**John:**	Removed them so it makes it a really uniform area of heating at the bottom of the pot and then you don't get little lines on the bottom of the pot so this allows you to simmer and easy non-stick food in the sauce pot.

So we added a 2.5 liter for that and then if you're making sauce and you cook for a large group then you need to be boiling a large quantity of water so we created a 4.5 liter stock pot. This stock pot has a lot of heat exchangers on the bottom because what we're trying to do is get as much heat into the water as fast as possible because you are boiling lots and lots of water here.

This one is the most efficient, fastest boiling pot because you're cooking stuff where you're boiling large quantities of water here. We have the variety of cookware, but one thing people love about system stoves is that they pack up perfectly. You can fit the two on the inside the pot and makes it as small as possible set up in your pack. So we wanted to maintain that with this system. I'll take this one out of the way here.

What we have here are, I have five pots ... We also have a skillet that comes with it ... I have five pots here, two stoves, two fuel canisters and a cup and I am going to pack them all of the systems everything together. Even though we have the new stove that seems to be a bit larger, we created this new leg system on it here that goes basically like that.

**Konstantin:**	So it basically is the same size as the original?

**John:**	Yes, it's like the canister stand but it is built into the stove and they deploy very easy. That also makes the pack extremely small so if you drop the fuel canister in the stove, it fits right into the pot just like the original stove and you put the hose in. Now you can create the system, that even though you have a stove that can cook for a whole group, it's small little personal, one person, fast and light packing, set-up like that.

That will actually pack inside the 1.8 liter pot. Yeah, everything fits into there. Put the lid on that, when you put the lid on then you have two pots and a stove all packed there and you put the cup in the bottom. For two pot, two person system if you really wanted to have that.

Now, most, in fact all stove systems up to this points stop packing in here. Once you get to larger pots you have a big stove rattling around inside of a pot.

We wanted to maintain that pack-ability on this pot system too so we get the 2.5 sauce pot and the big canister and it goes into the pot. You take the stove and the legs so that this fits exactly into on top of the fuel canister and the two lock together perfect. You have the round canister on the round bottom on the round side. This is round against the bottom.

**Konstantin:**	The legs just fit in.

**John:**	They fit in and they actually are above the bottom of the pot so they aren't scratching the pot

**Konstantin:**	Perfect.

**John:**	Yeah you could put some silverware or maybe some dehydrated food in there. You have a little extra space. [crosstalk 00:05:45] But the fuel and the stove don't rattle around because they were built to work with each other.

**Konstantin:**	May I try?

**John:**	You can.

When we get the lid to hold everything in place, we also put a latch on this so that you can hold the handle and strain like that. Then that little lock on for storage and we sized everything so when you're doing the ultimate kit this fits inside of that. If you take the extra handle off of our skillet, you will also fit it inside the pot. Then if I put the lid on this one, we put two latches so it is an easy straining holds everything together. The skillet is sized to work perfectly on that.

So that's 5 pots, 2 stoves, 2 fuel canisters and whole lids. All in a perfect package.

**Konstantin:**	So you can actually have a rather big group.

**John:**	Yes.

Konstantin:	And you can prepare food. It is also extremely light

**John:**	Yes. It's all lightweight aluminum but it has got durable ceramic coating and lightweight heat exchangers.

**Konstantin:**	It's all rather impressive. I believe it is a major step forward.
