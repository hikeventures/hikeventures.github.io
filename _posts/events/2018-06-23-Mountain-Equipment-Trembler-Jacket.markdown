The Trembler jacket is a very stylish and has a lightweight grit fleece which is
very breathable.  

Also, on the core body it's wind proof with a 20 denier fabric and you have
inside a grit fleece. So a bit warmer than the other sides.

Yeah and this is a perfect summer fleece to keep your core warm but at the
same time it has to be breathable and it's very climatise sizing so it's not too
warm and it's warm outside and a little bit wind proof on your core but
it will be warm when it's getting a bit chilly.

It's also very small pack size and this is a real fleece and
weighs only 195 grams from which is also quite low weight for
a fleece.

So with this product you can have a small tiny little package of
3 layers and you have only fun in the mountains when you go there for climbing
or walking and don't have heavy loads to carry.
