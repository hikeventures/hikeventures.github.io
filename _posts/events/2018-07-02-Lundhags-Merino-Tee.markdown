Could you tell us something about the new interesting products.

Yeah, so we do have some kind of a new product that are really working on the the base layer side.

So we've been developing like new fabrics that are really kind of for warm weather and really kind of water compatible as well.

So the idea is to use like recycled face fabric and get them kind of really really quick drying so we're gonna have like the Capilene for instance.

So the Capilene is basically really really soft fabric here.

That it is really pleasant against the skin it should be yeah so that's that's the main goal because it's gonna be always against your body but then you're gonna have UPF protection as well so you will be protected from the UV from the Sun.

So when you have long sleeves so it was really comfortable if you need you can roll it up.

Yeah exactly you have long-sleeve, short-sleeve you even have like tank tops and then the beauty of it is just like it's gonna dry in a short time.

Exactly that's it the perfect demo here.

Yeah just jumping into the water it's fine.

So that's kind of where we're going to focus for this season here really on those baselayers.

We have different weight and different type of fabric.but this one will be kind of the most kind of water compatible.
