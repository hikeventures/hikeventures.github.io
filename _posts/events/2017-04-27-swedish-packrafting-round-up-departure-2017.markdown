It's time again for the legendary Swedish Packrafting Meet-Up. In a few minutes we are leaving towards Sweden where we will meet other packrafters as well as Alpacka - the manufacturer of our packrafts.

Patrick will take the Viking Line ferry from Turku to Stockholm together with Caj and Katja while Konstantin is spending a night in Gdansk to take the early morning flight to Stockholm.

Once in Stockholm we will meet and drive around 4 hours to the meeting point. More about the Swedish Packrafting Round-Up soon on our blog. <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/">Here</a> you can read about last years packrafting event in Sweden.
