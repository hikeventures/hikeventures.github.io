Hi Caroline. Could you say something about the new products that Lundhags brings us this year.

Next year. For next year we will complete our trekking bags collection with some new bags that you can use when you're going trekking or going to the outdoor experiences.

So we have this duffel bag and we have a small bag and we also have this very nice tote bag which we call Ymse.

All our names are from Jämtland where we are from and these are really nice.

We have used all the same material as the big trekking bags that we launched 2018 and now to complete the family with bags we have made all these.

So if you like you're tracking bag you don't need to part with this you can
just have a city bag.

Also in the same style and the same materials. Same materials, same sustainable materials and organic cotton and polyester - recycled polyester.

It completes our family with packs and bags.
