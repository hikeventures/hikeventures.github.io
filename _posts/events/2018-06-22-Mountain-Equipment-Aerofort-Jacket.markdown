We have here a product which is especially made for the summer and which is in this lightweight or ultralight field.

Some would say ultra light they are very lightweight so let's say
ultra light if you like this better.

We have here from gore-tex this new Active Shell 2 which is a very good fabric and you have this fabric with an outer layer of 20 denier and you have knit lining inside which makes it very comfortable to wear and also very robust.

It only weighs 170 grams and goes into this stuff bag.

This is a real three layer not a two and a half layer like paclite or any other PU membrane.

It is very breathable and very lightweight but still robust and packs into this tiny little thing.

And it's a really long lasting gore-tex jacket.

It's like a good sized snowball. I used it a lot
during the winter and for testing and it works fantastic.

There is no problem that you're not afraid that you would have problems
because of the Rucksack so if I would go on a long trekking tour with a heavy rucksack I would definitely take another jacket.

And then we have here a windbreaker. So windbreakers have been for a long time on the market very long time and if you ever have used windbreakers it is always sticky to the skin.

You're very likely to use it without another long sleeve pull-on because you use it in warm weather and when you sweat they are not breathing very well.

Of course it's coated fabric. It's a real soft shell it's a 20 demier bubble weave soft shell with a mechanical fabric stretch.

So there is no nylon in. It stretch because it is how its woven. It is 100 grams and also fits into this internal pocket.

There have been windbreakers around which fits into this pocket but what is new is that you have this pack size. You have extreme good comfort of wearing it so it is not sticky.

It breezes very well and you feel very comfortable in and that's a great new thing you you need to try it.

This is a 3/4 because of weight because of weight it is close fitting its hand because we we are making it for active use.

When you want to sweat we learned that you lose up 20% of
your heat through the head.

This is a hood which would go under a helmet on bikes or on climbing.

When you're coming to the higher peaks, you can put it on when there is wind.

So I like this very very much and you can also adjust here. Yeah,
it's perfect
