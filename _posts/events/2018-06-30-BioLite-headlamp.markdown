This is completely new. So this is the very first Bio light 3d slim fit headlamp. We believe that there are three dimensions
to a great headlamp.

One is how thin is it right. How do we make a headlamp that isn't so bulky that you can forget that you're wearing it really and so one is a
very thin front that's integrated

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.570
directly into the textiles. The second
aspect is the weight has been

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
redistributed. So the batteries on the
back and the light is on the front. So

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
it's it really doesn't bounce or move
around as you move your head. And the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
third piece is the technical soft goods
which are very breathable but also very

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.950
comfortable and very stable. And so this
is a great headlamp for active outdoors

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.149
that you can really wear all night long
and it stays very comfortable. And how

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:06.830
powerful is it? So the headlamp is 300
and tell me when they're both on nope oh

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:19.320
no they thief just okay. So it's a 320
lumens and it'll run for three hours

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.750
three and a half hours at 320 lumens or
up to 40 hours on its lower settings. And

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.920
they're working on a USB charger. Yes,
they're USB rechargeable. And does it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.000
also adjust. Yes it's also adjustable. Yeah and I also

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.990
while they were clicking through the
whole setting I saw that you have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.710
red light. Yes there's also a red light
mode inside. So there's a whole

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.549
variety of different things. Yeah.
Okay, well it's a quite interesting

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.820
development. Thank you. Thank you and we
really feel like this is the first

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.399
headlamp that is truly like a modern
wearable like a SmartWatch you know we

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.259
brought that concept to the headlamp.
