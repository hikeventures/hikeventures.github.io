Hi, this is Konstantin from Hike Ventures, and I've got Bushcraft essentials with me.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you. Would you tell something about the range of the stoves that you've bought?

Of course, of course. We are manufacture good stoves, or actually they are multi-fuel stoves. But the main focus of the stoves is that they can be operated with wood, which is a great advantage because when you're outdoors, and you have to carry your stuff you don't want to carry all the fuel with you. So you can use wood with them.

So if you are in the area where there is wood, it's perfect.

It is perfect, otherwise when there's no wood, you can use all of the stoves, or most of the stoves, or all these stoves, for instance, with the trangia. Trangia fits perfectly into the stoves. We have those trivets, you can put the trivets in the side and just position it.

Will be positioned perfectly. All the stoves pack very, very small like this. This is also perfect for people who can't carry their stuff. Some of them are very light. This is ultralight, it's just 60 degrees, it's like paper, feels like paper.

Can I have a look?

Of course, of course.

Oh, it is really light ... a bit sharp as well because it's really thin, but-

Yeah, but you won't hurt yourself. So all of the stoves, the edges are treated so yeah, you can't hurt yourself.

Very nice.

Okay.

And this is the biggest one.

That is the biggest one, it gets about 800 degrees hot, so really, really hot. It just needs a little mountain wood, so it's very, very efficient. It gets so hot that you can even use damp wood, so wood which is a little bit wet.

So you need to prime it a little bit, and then you can-

Absolutely. Exactly, that's the point, yep.

Cool, it's quite interesting. Thank you very much.

You're welcome. Thank you for stopping by.
