**Hi, this is Konstantin and I've got Magnus from Houdini. Magnus, would you tell me something about your interesting products?**

Yeah, absolutely. Here we got the Power Houdi. It's a great Houdini product. It's made from Polartec Power Stretch Pro, which is a really nice fleece fabric and it's really warm, comfortable, has a nice fit to it so it's not too tight, but not too loosely fit, has a tight hoodie that works perfect underneath the shell we have here. I would say it's the best fleece on the market. Everybody should have one.

**This is quite interesting what about the quality of the material.**

Basically, you have one that's brand new and one that's 10 years old, and they look exactly the same. I would say I have maybe 10 Power Houdis in my wardrobe and the one like the most, it's the oldest one I got because it's the softest and it fits me perfect because I've been wearing it so much.

Then here, we have a new product called the Wooler Houdi, basically the same product design something really new to the market, it's 100% wool but it has this grid inside that makes it really warm but still breathable and it transportes more moisture.

It's also part of a new wool program that makes it 100% traceable so we know which farm all the wool comes from. Has a really nice micron to it so it's 7 1/2 microns which makes it super-super soft, make the skin and if you wear it without anything underneath.

It's biodegrable, so we think this is something that a lot of customers want to wear, good for nature and it's also super nice to wear.
