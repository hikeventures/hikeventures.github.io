Could you tell us something about the
new line, new things that you're going to have?

0:00:03.899,0:00:08.610
New things? Well we have we don't have a new
line but we have our new Allak 3 which

0:00:08.610,0:00:13.049
you can see I said Allak which we're now
we've had for a few years that we're now

0:00:13.049,0:00:18.390
calling the Allak 2 and now has a bigger
brother in the Allak 3.  You'll see you

0:00:18.390,0:00:22.740
can completely it's a comfortable three
person. Yeah, there is plenty of space

0:00:22.740,0:00:29.189
actually in there. The sitting height is 110
centimetres it's a tall guy like you can

0:00:29.189,0:00:34.260
easily sit in there and you can sleep in
there with two of your friends so either

0:00:34.260,0:00:39.390
for people who go up three people or
people who go who want a little more

0:00:39.390,0:00:45.870
space for two or if you go with your dog
that it's a really nice option also

0:00:45.870,0:00:52.710
quite a lot of space yeah on both sides
for luggage exactly so you have you can

0:00:52.710,0:00:59.190
easily fit three packs throughout so you
have the nice thing that Allak also you

0:00:59.190,0:01:03.469
sleep alongside about
so you can easily reach over and into

0:01:03.469,0:01:06.770
the rusticles
for the lx3 we've also added more

0:01:06.770,0:01:12.619
pockets you have three big pockets on
each side of the tent the Allak is a

0:01:12.619,0:01:15.979
little bit tapered so it's a little bit
wider up front another touch narrower

0:01:15.979,0:01:20.360
down below but you can see we have three
therm-a-rests here that you can fiddle

0:01:20.360,0:01:26.200
easily in here yeah so that's kind of
what we have that's our news this year

0:01:26.200,0:01:37.369
we're pretty excited about it we've been
using it a lot over the last year so it's really nice.

0:01:37.369,0:01:42.860
This is the mesh inner tent so for
most of our models we offer a mesh inner

0:01:42.860,0:01:47.060
tent like this and you can use it
separately like we have here then it has

0:01:47.060,0:01:50.959
a little foam holder kit so you can set
it up but you use the pole so you got

0:01:50.959,0:01:55.520
for your tent and use it separately
obviously then it's really a nice bug

0:01:55.520,0:02:01.700
protection it's not rain proof obviously
but it's bug proof is amazing protection

0:02:01.700,0:02:08.359
in hot dry areas or you can use it
inside your regular Allak 3 and just button

0:02:08.359,0:02:13.459
it in instead of directly do you want
more airiness. So this is this is for

0:02:13.459,0:02:16.790
four season
yep it's an all season this then makes

0:02:16.790,0:02:22.850
it a three season. With Allak where you
have their large doors alongside having

0:02:22.850,0:02:26.750
the mesh inner tent and then leaving the
doors completely rolled open. And

0:02:26.750,0:02:31.070
you have really made
views and really venting throughout. And

0:02:31.070,0:02:36.740
at the same time you have enough protection. So
obviously the inner tent that comes

0:02:36.740,0:02:40.550
with the Allak are also really good
for summer but if you want to use even

0:02:40.550,0:02:44.380
more airiness so you can use the Allak 3 mesh inner tent.

0:02:44.380,0:02:48.670
Thank you very much. Thank you.
