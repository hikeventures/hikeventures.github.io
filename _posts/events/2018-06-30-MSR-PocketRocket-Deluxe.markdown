Hi Philip could you say something about the new developments for 2019?

We're going to introduce the <a href="https://amzn.to/2tKENzS" rel="nofollow">PocketRocket Deluxe</a> stove.

It's a development from the Pocket Rocket 2.

It basically features a larger burner hat that allows you to have more versatility in cooking.

It's also able to to simmer which wasn't possible with the older PocketRocket.

For more comfort it features a Piezo igniter and to allow you to use it with an almost empty cartridge or in really low temperatures.

We have a pressure regulator integrated that always reduces the pressure from the cartridge to the absolute minimum so it doesn't matter in which conditions you use it.

That's what we have so far from the stove side.
