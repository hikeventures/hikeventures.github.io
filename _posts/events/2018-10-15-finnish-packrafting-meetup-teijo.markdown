Last weekend I went to the three days Packrafting meetup 2018 in Teijo National Park which has been founded in 2015, has about 79.000 visitors per year, covers an area of 34 km2 and has 50 km2 of marked trails.

We parked our cars nearby the Hamarij채rvi lake, inflated our packrafts and paddled to our first camp site. From there we paddled the next day to to the other side of the lake where we hiked to the Sahaj채rvi lake.

At Sahaj채rvi we had lunch at Kalasuntti and then paddled further to Kaniholma where we pitched our tents and visited with our packrafts the nearby brewery in a village called Matilda which was just a few hundred meters away.

At the brewery we enjoyed delicious sandwiches, ciders and pastries and some of us took a few bottles of beer back to the camp. The next day we paddled again to Matilda and carried our packrafts a few hundred meters to the sea (Hummelfj채rden).

From there we paddled a few kilometers until we reached a fire place where we had our last lunch. <a href="https://avisuora.wordpress.com">Janne</a> took a group picture of us, showed us new ways of taking selfies and we enjoyed his fantastic cheese cake.

Finally, we paddled another few kilometers back to the place where we parked our car (it was just a short hike from the sea to the car parking).

The meetups in Finland are organised in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1760898697500487/" rel="nofollow">Packrafting Finland Facebook group</a>. So if you plan to join us in the future just follow this group.
