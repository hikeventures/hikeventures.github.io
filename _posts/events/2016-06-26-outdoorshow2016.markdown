We decided this year not to visit the OutdoorShow in Friedrichshafen. After having visited the [ISPO 2016](http://www.hikeventures.com/ISPO-2016-interviews/) in Munich we decided that we will spend our time on a few trips and visit the OutdoorShow in Friedrichshafen in 2017.

Here are the 4 reasons why we won't be able to visit the OutDoor Show 2016.

## Japan
Konstantin will travel for a few weeks to Japan to hike and packraft there. He has been in Japan already [last year](http://www.hikeventures.com/travelling-japan/) and really enjoyed his trip in the far east.

## Russia
After Japan, Konstantin has plans to travel to Russia to packraft with a few other guys.

## France
Straight after Russia Konstantin is planning to travel to France to participate in a whitewater course with his packraft.

## Finland
Patrick is going to travel to Finnish Lapland for a packrafting and hiking adventure. Patrick is also planning to visit the [Siida museum](http://www.siida.fi/contents/sami-museum) to learn a bit more about the culture and life of the Sami people in Finland.

Of course it would have been nice to visit the Outdoor Show 2016 in Friedrichshafen but sometimes you have to set priorities and this year we have set them towards outdoor adventures. However, we will definitely attend the OutDoor Show 2017 in Friedrichshafen. It will be also a good opportunity for Patrick to visit his friends and family who are living at the Bodensee. See you in 2017!

So what did we expect? We had no idea. Yesterday we were walking up the hill and enjoyed a breathtaking view.
