*Did you know that King Tutankhamen’s sarcophagus was uncovered near Luxor in Egypt on January 3rd, 1924?*

Temperatures have dropped to -10°C here in Finland and the last days we were working quite hard on new articles and also on our blog. We are already excited to visit the ISPO show in a few weeks in Munich. By the way, the Deliverance Team is organising a [packrafting gathering][1] in Sweden in May and [urbanpackrafter.com][2] has finally his own [Facebook page][3]. So drop by and follow him on Facebook. Want to share your packrafting trips with us and our readers? Add them to our [packrafting trips directory][4]. #OutdoorsTidbits
