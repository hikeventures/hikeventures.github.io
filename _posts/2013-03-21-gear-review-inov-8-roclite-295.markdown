Are you looking for trail runners or lightweight hiking boots for your next hiking, backpacking or other backcountry trips? Then you could have a look on this short review about the Inov-8 Roclite 295. They might be not supportive like real hiking boots but if you are more towards ultralight hiking then trail runners (also called crossfit or cross training shoes) could be an interesting alternative depending on where you are planning to go.

## Features
The front of the shoes protects very well while walking in the mountains and the mesh on the shoes give an airy feeling. However, breathable shoes come on an expense - they are not not waterproof but in the case of the Roclite 295 they tend to dry quite quickly if it's warm. The Roclite 295 weight 295 grams.

## Recommendation
I have tested the Inov-8 Roclite 295 on <a href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">our trip to Sarek</a> in Sweden. Well, I had constantly wet feet with those shoes but on the other hand they were easy to attach on the backpack while packrafting. Most likely I would take proper hiking shoes if I would go to Sarek again in order to stay dry but if I would hike in an area which is less wet the Roclite 295 would work quite well as an ultralight hiking boot.
