Last week Patrick was testing his new Therm-a-Rest XTherm while Konstantin was still writing on his Fjällräven pants review which we will publish shortly. Konstantin also received his new Anfibio Windpaddle Sail and Anfibio Throwbag from the [Packrafting Store](http://www.packrafting-store.de). We are also working on a very short video from our [Lapland trip](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/) earlier this year.

## Trip reports and outdoor tips
Last week we read about the [Tamang Heritage Trail](https://michaelbrandeis1.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/the-tamang-heritage-trail/). One outdoor blogger wrote on
[how to lose toenails](http://thelatebloomerhiker.com/2015/03/25/how-to-lose-your-toenails-when-hiking) when hiking. If you are planning to go to the National Parks of Alberta then you could read
[here](http://www.rockiesfamilyadventures.com/2015/03/summer-planning-where-to-camp-in.html) where to camp. Another post focused on the topic if people belong in the [backcountry](https://biodiversitytheblog.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/do-people-like-you-belong-in-the-backcountry/). A German blogger went with huskies through [Lapland](http://unserereisekiste.com/2015/03/22/mit-huskys-durch-lappland-teil-2). If you are interested into backpacking food then you can read about [food intolerances](http://carrotquinn.com/2015/03/22/basically-i-eat-potato-chips-thru-hiking-with-the-most-common-food-intolerances/)  and [hiker’s diet](http://www.thehikinglife.com/journal/2015/03/the-hikers-diet/) on your hike. There have also been some Appalachian [Trail Lessons](https://hikergirl86.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/appalachian-trail-lessons-2/) published as well as [MicroAdventure](http://lonewalker.net/march-microadventure/) during March. Another blogger hiked the 
[Sawback Trail](http://besthike.com/2015/03/20/sawback-trail-banff-to-lake-louise/) from Banff National Park. Finally there are some tips for hiking in the [spring](https://georgiatomaine2013.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/10-tips-for-hiking-in-the-spring/), how to take care of your 
[foot](http://blissfulhiking.blogspot.com/2015/03/foot-care.html) while on the trail and how to become a [better hiker](https://georgiatomaine2013.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/how-to-become-a-better-more-efficient-hiker/).

## Gear Reviews
There has been some interesting reviews about backpacks like the [Kelty Catalyst 65](http://treelinebackpacker.com/2015/03/27/kelty-catalyst-65-backpack-review), [Granite Gear Boundary Campus](http://treelinebackpacker.com/2015/03/21/granite-gear-boundary-campus-backpack-review), the frameless [LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK](http://besthike.com/2015/03/23/the-frameless-laufbursche-huckepack/) or the [Crux AK37 pack](http://www.thealpinestart.com/2015/03/field-tested-crux-ak37-pack/).

If you are into kayaking then there is a review about the
[Aquaglide Tandem XL Inflatable Kayak](https://airkayaks.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/choosing-an-aquaglide-tandem-xl-inflatable-kayak-chelan-vs-columbia-vs-chinook/). Another blogger wrote published a few options about [Car-Camping Sleeping Bags](http://jcjustcamping.com/car-camping-sleeping-bags). If you are into Merino wool then a review of the 
[Icebreaker Helix LS Zip Review (in German)](https://www.hiking-blog.de/test/praxistest-icebreaker-helix-ls-zip-isolationsjacke-aus-merinowolle/) could be interesting to read. Ultralight hikers could have a look into the review about the
[GoLite Imogene UL3](http://hikenoworklater.com/2015/03/24/gear-review-golite-imogene-ul3) or the [Big Agnes Slater UL2+](http://sunrisegear.blogspot.com/2015/03/big-agnes-slater-ul2.html). As we are getting closer to summer, some of you might also be interested in new sunglasses and here is a [review](http://www.hochtourist.at/testbericht-julbo-montebianco-cameleon/) about the Julbo MonteBianco Cameleon Review in German. Finally, there is a review about the La Sportiva [Nepal Cube GTX Boot](http://www.thealpinestart.com/2015/03/la-sportiva-nepal-cube-gtx-boot-review/) if you are into ice climbing. If you are still looking for a backpacking knife then the [review](http://treelinebackpacker.com/2015/03/21/morakniv-pro-s-review) about the MORAKNIV PRO S might be interesting to read.
