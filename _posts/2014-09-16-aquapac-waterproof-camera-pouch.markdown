My Sony A7r arrived - but hey, how should I protect it from all the rain the water when I hike and <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-unpacking-alpacka-packraft/" target="_self">packraft</a>? Since I want to travel light, the bag should be small and light as well. After an email discussion with the aquapac customer service, I decided to go for their bags and here comes a short review about the Aquapac Camera Pouch.

## Features
The Aquapac Camera Pouch is durable, waterproof (IPX6 certified), with 128 grams also small and light, is able to float on the water and works till - 40 C. It can also be attached in many ways on a bag.

The pouch seals the camera completely against the worst rain. The aquapac waterproof camera pouch also protects the camera when you want to take your camera into your <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-unpacking-alpacka-packraft/" target="_self">packraft</a>.

This bag is small and fits easily into every backpack. You can carry it with a shoulder strap or attach it on a belt or even on your <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-unpacking-alpacka-packraft/" target="_self">packraft</a> with the integral lash tab. The pouch has no external pockets and it takes a little more time to open and to close it since you have a roll-down seal. However, I was quite happy with the pouch during my last trips with my Sony A7r.

## Recommendation
Manufacturing and materials seems to have high quality on the Aquapac Waterproof Camera Pouch. This seems to be a good bag for outdoor activities where water is involved. However, I found it a bit difficult to access the camera quickly. The Ortlieb camera bags seems to be a better alternative regarding accessing your camera quickly.  The Aquapac  Waterproof Camera Pouch has 5 years warranty and is PVC free. The Aquapac customer service was also helpful. I always got an answer to my emails and was promised to send the pouch bag in case the size would be too small.
