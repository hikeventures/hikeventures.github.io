Today I would like to present you the best outdoor GPS watches with color display which you can wear on your next hiking or backpacking trip, for running or on any other outdoor activity. At the moment I am wearing a [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) which has a monochrome display. I am quite satisfied with my [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) so far but I would be interested to get an outdoor watch which features a color display.

Probably one disadvantage of watches having a colour display and a GPS was their short battery life in the past. The <a href="http://amzn.to/1YdNH1H" rel="nofollow">Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10</a> advertises it's watch with 3 days in monochrome mode however the WDS-F10 does not have a GPS built in. My Traverse lasts approximately 1 day if I switch the GPS on depending on the tracking frequency and GPS accuracy.

The watches in my list are sorted by their weight and I have taken the specifications like the battery life from the manufacturers website. I have not tested the watches myself yet.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/1t7QAFm" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Sport 38mm</a>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WP9NFUG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00WP9NFUG&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=3200cc07a8c693c957f3fda23a3d495c"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00WP9NFUG&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00WP9NFUG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 25 grams  
**Battery Life:** 18 hours  
**Operating System:** watchOS 2  
**Water Resistance:** IPX7 - splash and water resistant but not waterproof

The Apple Watch Sport 38mm is for those folks who like to have their Apple phone with them. Unfortunately, the Apple Watch (like the Casio WSD-F10) lacks a built in GPS and might not be suited for those who would like to leave their mobile phone at home.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/1t7QAFm" rel="nofollow">Motorola Moto 360 Sport</a>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016CKHAZO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B016CKHAZO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4c6098a87f5b1865e89b5e207acc1007"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B016CKHAZO&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B016CKHAZO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 54 grams  
**Battery Life:** 1 day  
**Operating System:** Android Wear™  
**Water Resistance:** IP67 - not   waterproof   
**Display:** 360x325

**Wi-Fi:** yes

Another interesting Outdoor watch is the Motorola Moto 360 Sport which is targeted towards Android users as it has the AndroidWear™ operating system on board. It also features an optical hear rate monitor directly on the watch which can only be found on the Apple watch so far. No need to wear a hear rate monitor around your chest. One highlight of the Moto 360 Sport is probably it's high resolution / display.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/1YdNH1H" rel="nofollow">Casio WSD-F10</a>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CY1QXR6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01CY1QXR6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=e259bc0b895c4a2b5cc6dec4c027ab7f"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01CY1QXR6&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01CY1QXR6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Casio WSD-F10 is the latest smart watch from Casio. It's one of the few watches which have AndroidWear installed as an operating system. If I would have an Android phone then this watch could be an interesting choice if would not need a built in GPS in my watch.

Apple users should probably look at an alternative watch as the the Casio WSD-F10 can only be connected to Android phones.

In general, I found that the Casio WSD-F10 looks quite nice. I like the displays and AndroidWear as an OS should probably offer nice upgrade functionalities in the future. The only disadvantage I see with this watch is that I basically need to carry my smartphone with me as the watch does not have a built-in GPS. For me as a runner and hiker I would prefer a watch with a dedicated GPS module on board.

The Suunto Spartan is the latest smart watch addition in the Suunto range. Unfortunately, there are no specifications about the Suunto Spartan available yet beside that it's going to be the first Suunto watch which features a colour display. As Suunto watches can be connected to Moveslink - the Suunto Online Sport Community - it is possible to use the Suunto Spartan either with your Android phone or with your iphone. I will updated this section  about the Suunto Spartan in a few weeks.

## Conclusion
From the currently released outdoor watches with color display I would probably pick the [Garmin Fenix 3](http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-fenix-3-bundle). However, before buying any watch I will wait to see the specifications of the [Suunto Spartan Ultra](http://www.suunto.com/sports-watch-collections/Suunto-Spartan-Collection/). As a current [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) user I have already my GPS data stored in [Movescount](http://www.movescount.com/members/member140205-HikeVentures) so switching brands is anyway not an easy option for me. If I would not need a built-in GPS then I would probably buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/1t7QAFm" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Sport</a> as an Apple phone user or the <a href="http://amzn.to/1t7QAFm" rel="nofollow">Motorola Moto 360 Sport</a> or the <a href="http://amzn.to/1YdNH1H" rel="nofollow">Casio WSD-F10</a> if I would be an Android phone user.
