Have you ever been on a hike and one of the buckles on your backpack broke or got damaged? When this happens your equipment might become uncomfortable to use, loose some of its functionality or it becomes completely useless as long as the buckle has not been replaced. You might even have to throw out your backpack just because of a broken buckle although the backpack is still in top shape. In this situation you probably wished to have a replacement buckle handy that is easy to install.<br><br>

Here’s where the K-Clip can help. The K-Clip is a field-replaceable buckle which can be easily installed. Apparently you don’t even need tools for the assembly, provided that the old buckle has been completely removed.

Apart from this, it can be installed without the need to open any stitches on your equipment. You know these tightly sown loops of the strap that hold the buckle? No need to open them when installing the K-Clip.

On the downside, its strength is probably reduced when compared to your original single piece buckle. But hey, as long as it allows you to continue on your hike and you can still use your beloved backpack, we think that it is a good idea.

Have a look at the K-Clip on their <a href="http://www.mykclip.com">website</a>. While these guys haven’t got it on sale yet, they have just launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/493007570/k-clip-the-field-replaceable-buckle">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the first round of production. 

If you want to help them out, just back their project. In return you will be one of the first to get the hands on the K-Clip, provided the funding campaign is successful.
Alternatively, you can just visit their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mykclip">Facebook page</a> and help them spread the word.
