Are you looking for a new tent and want to know which one is the best solo backpacking tent? Well, the best 1-person tent can be a different one in different environments and situations. Are you planning a trip to remote areas? Do you want to use your tent during the winter? Or are you an ultralight aficionado?

I would like to give an overview about the best solo backpacking tents available for 2016. It's important to know that each tent is made for a specific purpose so there is no one tent fits all tent. Some also prefer to sleep in a tarp rather than in a tent. However, I will not include any tarps in this article.

Further, it's also worth to consider that a 1-person tent can be more heavy than a 2-person tent if you would distribute the weight of the 2-person tent over 2 persons. So hiking with another person can make you carry less weight.

### [Hilleberg Enan](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Enan-1-Person-Tent_10274355_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UZ8ZNDQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UZ8ZNDQ&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=XBQVK7AJ3UD7ESR7"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZ8ZNDQ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UZ8ZNDQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 215 cm  
**Width:** 60 cm (95cm)   
**Height:** 95 cm  
**Inner Space:** 1.7 m²  
**Vestibule:** 0.8 m²  
**Weight:** 1100 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 600   

The Hilleberg Enan is the ultralight model of the Akto. If you don't require much space and use your tent only during the warmer months (3-season) then the Hilleberg Enan might be a good option. This type of tent is good for fast pack and go. If you are more into base camping, are very tall or want to have more space e.g. during a longer period of rain then the Hilleberg Anjan 2 or the Hilleberg Unna would be a better choice. The Enan has a mesh on one end which should provide great ventilation if pitched in wind direction.

### [Hilleberg Akto](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Akto-1-Person-Tent_10101417_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X2HQPY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003X2HQPY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=FCTXO35WV5CXK5P7"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B003X2HQPY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003X2HQPY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 62 cm (90cm)   
**Height:** 93 cm   
**Inner Space:** 1.7 m²    
**Vestibule:** 0.8 m²    
**Weight:** 1700 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200   

The Hilleberg Akto is the 4-season model of the Hilleberg Enan and more suitable for harsh weather conditions than the Hilleberg Enan. It is a bit longer than the Hilleberg Enan and more suitable if you are taller. This comes at an additional weight of 600 grams. However, [condensation](http://dzjow.com/2011/11/21/9-years-with-a-hilleberg-akto/ "Codensation Hilleberg") might be an issue with this tent (also reported [here](http://www.backpacking.net/hilleberg-akto-review.html#condensation "condensation Hilleberg") which is of course bad if you plan a longer tour with a down sleeping bag and you face a long period or rain or moisture where you are not able to dry your sleeping bag during the day. Another reason why I would opt for a bigger tent like the Hilleberg Anjan 2 or Hilleberg Unna if you need a 4-season tent because it's less likely that your sleeping bag touches the inner tent if you have more space.

### [Hilleberg Niak 1.5](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Niak-1-5-Person-Tent_10306870_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT52A08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01AT52A08&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=2JIQ4SO5RH5PZJXL"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01AT52A08&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B01AT52A08" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is a non-freestanding 1-2 person tent.

**Fabric:** Kerlon 600   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²  

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is the latest yellow label tent from Hilleberg. If you need more space than in the Hilleberg Enan e.g. if there is a longer rain period where you have to sit in the tent or if you want to take your dog with you. The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is more a 1-person rather han a 2-person tent and comes with a vestibule to store your gear. If you need a spacious solo 3-season tent then the Hilleberg Niak 1.5 could be a good choice if you are looking for a tent with low weight. Alternatively, I would choose the MSR Hubba Hubba NX which is also less pricey and offers slightly more room.

### [MSR Hubba NX](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-hubba-nx-tent-1-person-3-season)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GP11DOK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GP11DOK&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=S7HOMFZX4PJW2LDW"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP11DOK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00GP11DOK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The MSR Hubba NX is a freestanding 3-season 1-person tent.

**Fabric:** 20D ripstop / 30D ripstop (floor)   
**Weight:** 1.29 kg kg   
**Area inner tent:** 1.67 m²  

The MSR Hubba NX is also a great 3-season tent and costs much less than the Hilleberg Niak 1.5. However, the Hilleberg has a stronger floor material (50D). If you are low on budget then the MSR Hubba would be our pick. If you want a freestanding 4-season tent then go for the Hilleberg Unna.

### [Hilleberg Anjan 2](http://www.bentgate.com/hilleberg-anjan-2-tent/)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IU0XEW8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IU0XEW8&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=CJ3OYX574GJJ5DNZ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU0XEW8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00IU0XEW8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 130 cm   
**Height:** 100 cm   
**Inner Space:** 2.8 m²    
**Vestibule:** 2.4 m²    
**Weight:** 1800 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1000    

The Hilleberg Anjan was our summer tent (even so I have the 3 person model) before we replaced it with the MSR Hubba Hubba NX (see above) because we enjoyed the seperate entrances and vestibules which the Hubba NX offers. The Hubba Hubba NX also has an inner tent which offers you the possibility to look outside. For the  Hilleberg Anjan you have to buy a seperate inner mesh. The Hilleberg Anjan is 700 grams more heavy than the Enan but you get lot's of space and may even use it as a 2-person tent. Your sleeping bag is less likely to become wet (except at the foot end from my own experience but you can cover the foot part of your sleeping bag with your waterproof jacket. If you have to sit in the tent for a longer period then having more space is much more beneficial in terms of comfort.

### [Hilleberg Unna](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Unna-1-Person-Tent_10101489_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IU0UMSC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IU0UMSC&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=IH74WSYOYDCATOTX"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU0UMSC&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00IU0UMSC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 230 cm   
**Width:** 110 cm   
**Height:** 100 cm   
**Inner Space:** 2.5 m²     
**Vestibule:** 0 m²    
**Weight:** 2200 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200   

The Hilleberg Unna is completely freestanding. The advantage of the Unna is the big entrance which can be used as a panorama window and that you can create a vestibule by detaching one corner of the inner tent while still having enough space to sleep in it. The Hilleberg Unna can also be used as a 2-person tent but you may not have a lot of space. The Hilleberg Unna is a 4-season tent. Make sure that you get the Mesh inner tent for the Hilleberg Unna to get a much better ventilation during the summer months. The Hilleberg Unna is my favourite 1-person tent which I would consider to buy as it is self-standing and should do a great job on paddling trips with a Kajak or Packraft as well.

### [Hilleberg Soulo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Soulo-1-Person-Tent_10101479_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LAP3G6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LAP3G6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4R5WXJMR7LNA2MKY"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004LAP3G6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004LAP3G6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 105 cm    
**Height:** 95 cm    
**Inner Space:** 2.0 m²    
**Vestibule:** 0.6 m²    
**Weight:** 2400 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200  

The Hilleberg Soulo is a solo expedition tent which can be used under very harsh condition. It's stronger than the Unna and has a designated vestibule, however the inner tent offers less space than the Unna. This tent could (like the Unna) be useful for sea kayaking or mountaineering as it is completely freestanding. It's a bit more heavy and shorter than the Unna. If you don't need a self-standing 4-season tent then I would choose the MSR Hubba NX or the MSR Hubba Hubba NX (2-person tent) if you need more space.

### [Hilleberg Nallo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Nallo-2-Person-Tent_10101453_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMR6HSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMR6HSO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4YIQPTOP7VXOY4EM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMR6HSO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMR6HSO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 130 cm   
**Height:** 100 cm   
**Inner Space:** 2.8 m²    
**Vestibule:** 1.3 m²     
**Weight:** 2400 grams    
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200  

The Hilleberg Nallo is probably the best choice if you want a 4-season tent which offers the most space and a vestibule for the least weight. If you don't need a freestanding tent and want the best weight/space ratio 4-season tent then you should pick the Hilleberg Nallo.

### [Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/ultamid-2.html)

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26835366172/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Tent &amp; Ultamid Tarp"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/26835366172_4b9630972f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="723" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Tent &amp; Ultamid Tarp"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**Length:** 271.8 cm   
**Width:** 210.8 cm   
**Height:** 162.6 cm   
**Weight:** 499 grams    
**Fabric:** Dyneema® (Cuben Fiber)

If you are looking for a fast and light tent which also protects you from bugs then the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2 could be your choice. The UltaMid 2 is an ultralight tent which works well if you are planning to camp on unexposed environments. I took the picture above of the UltaMid 2 tent on the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/">packrafting round-up in Sweden</a>. There were actually 2 of those Ultra-Mids on this event. The only issue I have with the white cuben fiber fabric is that it might lose it's shiny white color after a while. That's why I ordered my Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter 4400 backpack a few years ago in black.

## Winter camping
If I would need to choose a tent for winter camping then I would rather opt for a bigger tent with a vestibule than the ones listed here.

## Conclusion
Every tent is made for it's own purpose.

### Best self-standing 1-person tent for exposed & harsh environments
The Hilleberg Soulo seems to be the toughest tent for stormy weather and winter camping but comes with additional weight. If you are taller than 175 cm then I would recommend you to get the Hilleberg Unna instead (which is also my favourite tent even so I like the external design of the Soulo more).

### Best 1-Berson tent with priority on space and vestibule
If you are looking for a sturdy tent with lots of space and a vestibule then you should get the Hilleberg Anjan 2 or the MSR Hubba NX as a 3-season tent or the Hilleberg Nallo 2 as a 4-season tent. These tents are not self-standing.

### Best 1-person ultralight tent
If low weight is your most important factor then you should consider the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Ulta Mid tent, followed by the Hilleberg Enan (or the Hilleberg Niak 1.5 if you need more space). MSR also offers the new MSR FreeLite 1 (1000 grams) and the MSR Carbon Reflex 1 (790 grams) but they are less durable than the MSR Hubba NX (1290 grams). We found that the floor fabric on the MSR Hubba NX was already quite delicate and the MSR Freelite 1 and MSR Carbon Reflex 1 have a slightly lower weight because they are having a thinner material on the floor and the rainfly than the MSR Hubba NX. Also keep in mind that the shiny white color of the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid will turn into greyish over the time.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25215098683/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1472/25215098683_07c6ffbfb8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
   
On our packrafting trip in Scotland we had a MSR Hubba Hubba NX with us which is also a great 3-season tent, offers space for 2 and costs less than the Hilleberg tents.

## Final word
My personal preference goes towards the Hilleberg Unna as my favourite solo backpacking tent as it is self-standing, offers inside more space than the Hilleberg Soulo and can also be pitched on difficult terrain. The Hilleberg Unna can also be used as a winter tent. The Hilleberg Unna has more weight than for example the MSR Hubba NX or the Hilleberg Enan / Niak but you get a tent which works in every condition and is more durable which is especially important if you are planning to hike in remote areas for a longer period. I also want to mention that weight is not the most important factor for me. I rather prefer durability and comfort on a low weight.

Finally, if you are into sea kayaking a self-standing durable tent against strong winds is probably a better option than an ultralight tent. If you are still not sure if you should buy the Hilleberg Soulo or the Hilleberg Unna then you should also consider your height. I am 180 cm tall and the Hilleberg Soulo was just too short for me. My foot / head touched the tent walls of the Hilleberg Soulo which means that my sleeping bag would get wet during the night (wet down does not insulate). There is also the Hilleberg Inner Mesh available for the Hilleberg Unna which I would buy additionally to modify the Hilleberg Unna to a summer tent with better air ventilation. The mesh is also available for the Hilleberg Soulo.

Here is also an [article](http://www.hikeventures.com/packrafting-Njuoreatnu-Tornetrask-abisko/ "Packrafting in Sweden") about our packrafting trip in the Swedish mountains where we were camping in our MSR Hubba Hubba NX. After one year of usage we have a slight hole on the floor but otherwise we have no complaints about it as a 3-season tent.
