Are you looking for a new tent and want to know which one is the best solo backpacking tent? Well, the best 1-person tent can be a different one in different environments and situations. Are you planning a trip to remote areas? Do you want to use your tent during the winter? Or are you an ultralight aficionado?

I would like to give an overview about the best solo backpacking tents available for 2016. It's important to know that each tent is made for a specific purpose so there is no one tent fits all tent. Some also prefer to sleep in a tarp rather than in a tent. However, I will not include any tarps in this article.

Further, it's also worth to consider that a 1-person tent can be more heavy than a 2-person tent if you would distribute the weight of the 2-person tent over 2 persons. So hiking with another person can make you carry less weight.

## [Fly Creek HV UL1](https://www.rei.com/product/895953/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul1-tent)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSYH1T0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GSYH1T0&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=UQ5VQ5S2FSWYOS4K"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSYH1T0&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00GSYH1T0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL1 is a 1-person and 3-season tent.

**Length:** 218 cm  
**Width:** 71 cm (95cm)   
**Height:** 97 cm  
**Inner Space:** 1.8 m²  
**Vestibule:** 0.45 m²  
**Weight:** 935 grams   

The Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL1 is a new product in the Big Agnes Ultralight tent range. It is a bit longer and taller than the Hilleberg Enan but has a smaller vestibule. Fly and floor have 1200mm waterproof polyurethane coating.

## [Hilleberg Enan](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Enan-1-Person-Tent_10274355_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UZ8ZNDQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UZ8ZNDQ&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=XBQVK7AJ3UD7ESR7"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZ8ZNDQ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UZ8ZNDQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Enan is a 1-person and 3-season tent.

**Length:** 215 cm  
**Width:** 60 cm (95cm)   
**Height:** 95 cm  
**Inner Space:** 1.7 m²  
**Vestibule:** 0.8 m²  
**Weight:** 1100 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 600   

The Hilleberg Enan is the ultralight model of the Akto. If you don't require much space and use your tent only during the warmer months (3-season) then the Hilleberg Enan might be a good option. This type of tent is good for fast pack and go. If you are more into base camping, are very tall or want to have more space e.g. during a longer period of rain then the Hilleberg Nallo would be a better choice. The Enan has a mesh on one end which should provide great ventilation if pitched in wind direction.

## [Marmot Force UL 2P](http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-force-ul-2p-tent-2-person-3-season)

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M85RDHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00M85RDHS&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=5f772e039fab5f9894178931a800150c"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00M85RDHS&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00M85RDHS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Marmot Force UL 2P is a freestanding 3-season tent for two persons.

**Persons:** 2   
**Fabric:** 15D ripstop / 20D ripstop (floor)   
**Weight:** 1.320 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²   

Even so the Marmot Force UL 2P is advertised as a 2 person tent, I would rather use it as a 1 person tent. As the tent has a rather thin floor, I would also get a [tent footprint](http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-force-ul-2p-footprint) with this tent. If you are looking for a light 3-season tent then the Marmot UL 2P could be a good option. I have used the Marmot Force UL 2P on my trips in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/) and [Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/Finnmark/).

## [Hilleberg Akto](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Akto-1-Person-Tent_10101417_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X2HQPY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003X2HQPY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=FCTXO35WV5CXK5P7"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B003X2HQPY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003X2HQPY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Akto is a 1-person and 4-season tent.

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 62 cm (90cm)   
**Height:** 93 cm   
**Inner Space:** 1.7 m²    
**Vestibule:** 0.8 m²    
**Weight:** 1700 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200   

The Hilleberg Akto is the 4-season model of the Hilleberg Enan and more suitable for harsh weather conditions than the Hilleberg Enan. It is a bit longer than the Hilleberg Enan and more suitable if you are taller. This comes at an additional weight of 600 grams. However, [condensation](http://dzjow.com/2011/11/21/9-years-with-a-hilleberg-akto/ "Codensation Hilleberg") might be an issue with this tent (also reported [here](http://www.backpacking.net/hilleberg-akto-review.html#condensation "condensation Hilleberg") which is of course bad if you plan a longer tour with a down sleeping bag and you face a long period or rain or moisture where you are not able to dry your sleeping bag during the day. Another reason why I would opt for a bigger tent like the Hilleberg Nallo 2 rather than the Hilleberg Soulo if you need a 4-season tent is because it's less likely that your sleeping bag touches the inner tent if you have a longer and wider tent.

## [Hilleberg Niak 1.5](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Niak-1-5-Person-Tent_10306870_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT52A08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01AT52A08&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=2JIQ4SO5RH5PZJXL"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01AT52A08&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B01AT52A08" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is a freestanding 1-2 person tent for 3-seasons.

**Fabric:** Kerlon 600   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²  

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is the latest yellow label tent from Hilleberg. If you need more space than in the Hilleberg Enan e.g. if there is a longer rain period where you have to sit in the tent or if you want to take your dog with you. The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is more a 1-person rather han a 2-person tent and comes with a vestibule to store your gear. If you need a spacious solo 3-season tent then the Hilleberg Niak 1.5 could be a good choice if you are looking for a tent with low weight. Alternatively, I would choose the MSR Hubba Hubba NX which is also less pricey and offers slightly more room.

## [MSR Hubba NX](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-hubba-nx-tent-1-person-3-season)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GP11DOK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GP11DOK&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=S7HOMFZX4PJW2LDW"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP11DOK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00GP11DOK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The MSR Hubba NX is a freestanding 3-season 1-person tent.

**Fabric:** 20D ripstop / 30D ripstop (floor)   
**Weight:** 1290 grams   
**Area inner tent:** 1.67 m²  

The MSR Hubba NX is also a great 3-season tent and costs much less than the Hilleberg Niak 1.5. However, the Hilleberg has a stronger floor material (50D). If you are low on budget then the MSR Hubba would be our pick. If you want a freestanding 4-season tent then go for the Hilleberg Soulo.

## [Hilleberg Soulo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Soulo-1-Person-Tent_10101479_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LAP3G6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LAP3G6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4R5WXJMR7LNA2MKY"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004LAP3G6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004LAP3G6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Akto is a 1-person and 4-season tent.

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 105 cm    
**Height:** 95 cm    
**Inner Space:** 2.0 m²    
**Vestibule:** 0.6 m²    
**Weight:** 2400 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200  

The Hilleberg Soulo is a solo expedition tent which can be used under very harsh condition. It's stronger than the Hilleberg Unna and has a designated vestibule, however the inner tent offers less space than the Unna. This tent could (like the Unna) be useful for sea kayaking or mountaineering as it is completely freestanding. It's a bit heavier and shorter than the Unna. If you don't need a self-standing 4-season tent then I would choose the MSR Hubba NX or the MSR Hubba Hubba NX (2-person tent) if you need more space. If you don't plan to do winter camping then the Hilleberg Soulo is probably going to be too much tent for your needs.

## [Hilleberg Nallo](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_Hilleberg-Nallo-2-Person-Tent_10101453_10208_10000001_-1_)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMR6HSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMR6HSO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4YIQPTOP7VXOY4EM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMR6HSO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMR6HSO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Akto is a 1-person and 4-season tent.

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 130 cm   
**Height:** 100 cm   
**Inner Space:** 2.8 m²    
**Vestibule:** 1.3 m²     
**Weight:** 2400 grams    
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200  

The Hilleberg Nallo is probably the best choice if you want a 4-season tent which offers the most space and a vestibule for the least weight. If you don't need a freestanding tent and want the best weight/space ratio 4-season tent then you should pick the Hilleberg Nallo.

## [Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/ultamid-2.html)

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26835366172/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Tent &amp; Ultamid Tarp"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/26835366172_4b9630972f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="723" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Tent HMG &amp; Ultamid Tarp - Best 1-person tent"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Hilleberg Akto is a 2-person and 4-season tent.

**Length:** 271.8 cm   
**Width:** 210.8 cm   
**Height:** 162.6 cm   
**Weight:** 499 grams    
**Fabric:** Dyneema® (Cuben Fiber)

If you are looking for a fast and light tent which also protects you from bugs then the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid 2 could be your choice. The UltaMid 2 is an ultralight tent which is supposed to work well in bad weather. I took the picture above of the UltaMid 2 tent on the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/">packrafting round-up in Sweden</a>. There were actually 2 of those Ultra-Mids on this event. The only issue I have with the white cuben fiber fabric is that it might lose it's shiny white color after a while. That's why I ordered my Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter 4400 backpack a few years ago in black.

# Accessories

## [Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil eVENT Compression Dry Sack](http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-event-compression-dry-sack)

Usually, I put my tent into a compression sack to get more space in my backpack and keep the poles and pegs seperated. The Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil eVENT Compression Dry Sack is currently my favourite compression sack.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SUDY9EM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00SUDY9EM&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=16d737f5ad282e8329e468a92146474a"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00SUDY9EM&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00SUDY9EM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

## [MSR Carbon Stake Kit](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-carbon-core-tent-stakes)

The MSR Carbok Stake Kit is one of my favourite accessories. You can safe quite some weight with those pegs as each of them weights only 6 grams.

## [MPOWERD Luci Outdoor - Inflatable Solar Light](https://www.rei.com/product/100705/mpowerd-luci-original-inflatable-solar-lantern)

The MPOWERD Luci Outdoor is probably one of the best products you can take on your camping trip. You charge the lamp during your hike. Once it gets dark you inflate Luci and you have plenty of light. Read also our [review](http://www.hikeventures.com/luci-r-outdoor-not-a-toy/).

Every tent is made for it's own purpose.

## Best self-standing 1-person tent for exposed & harsh environments
The Hilleberg Soulo seems to be the toughest tent for stormy weather and winter camping but comes with additional weight. 

## Best 1-Berson tent with priority on space and vestibule
If you are looking for a sturdy tent with lots of space and a vestibule then you should get the Hilleberg Nallo, Hilleberg Niak or the MSR Hubba NX as a 3-season tent or the Hilleberg Nallo 2 as a 4-season tent (these tents are not self-standing). 

## Best 1-person ultralight tent
If low weight is your most important factor then you should consider the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Ulta Mid tent, the Hilleberg Enan (or the Hilleberg Niak 1.5 if you need more space), the MSR Hubba NX or the Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL1 tent. The prices on the MSR and the Big Agnes are considerably lower than on the Hilleberg tents.

MSR also offers the new MSR FreeLite 1 (1000 grams) and the MSR Carbon Reflex 1 (790 grams) but they are less durable than the MSR Hubba NX (1290 grams). We found that the floor fabric on the MSR Hubba NX was already quite delicate and the MSR Freelite 1 and MSR Carbon Reflex 1 have a slightly lower weight because they are having a thinner material on the floor and the rainfly than the MSR Hubba NX. Also keep in mind that the shiny white color of the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid will turn into greyish over the time.

On our packrafting trip in Scotland we had a MSR Hubba Hubba NX with us which is also a great 3-season tent, offers space for 2 and costs less than the Hilleberg tents.

# Final word
My personal preference goes towards the Hilleberg Soulo or the Hilleberg Nallo 2 as my favourite solo 4-season backpacking tent. The Hilleberg Soulo is self-standing and can also be pitched on difficult terrain. Many use those tents also as a 3-season tent. If you get an inner mesh tent from Hilleberg then you can even get a better air ventilation in your tent. The Nallo offers more space than the Soulo and would be my first choice (even so the tent is called Nallo 2, it's better suited as a solo tent than a 2-person tent).

If I were to choose an ultralight 3-season tent then I would probably go for the Hilleberg Niak or the Hilleberg Enan (smaller than the Hilleberg Niak) or if I were on a budget then the MSR Hubba NX and the Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL1 Tent.

The Hilleberg Soulo is certainly more durable than the ultralight 3-season tents but if you treat them carefully then they should also last for a while and you don't have to carry too much weight.

Finally, if you are into sea kayaking a self-standing durable tent - like the Hilleberg Soulo or the Hilleberg Nallo 2 - which can handle strong winds is probably a better option than an ultralight tent as you don't have to carry the tent anyway when you are paddling.

Here is also an [article](http://www.hikeventures.com/packrafting-Njuoreatnu-Tornetrask-abisko/ "Packrafting in Sweden") about our packrafting trip in the Swedish mountains where we were camping in our MSR Hubba Hubba NX. After one year of usage we have a slight hole on the floor but otherwise we have no complaints about it as a 3-season tent.
