In this article I would like to give an overview about the best solo person backpacking tents available for 2015 / 2016 (personal view). I focus on Hilleberg tents as I already owned 2 Hillebegs in the past. I also added a MSR tent as I found it a good alternative which costs less than most of the Hilleberg tents. It's also important to know that each tent is made for a specific purpose so there is no one tent fits all purposes tent. Also it's worth to consider that a 1-person tent can be more heavy than a 2-person tent if you would distribute the weight of the 2-person tent over each person.

The Enan is the ultralight model of the Akto.  If you don't require much space and use your tent only during the warmer months (3-season) then the Enan might be a good option. This type of tent is good for fast pack and go. If you are more into base camping, are very tall or want to have more space e.g. during a longer period of rain then the Anjan 2 or the Unna would be a better choice. The Enan has a mesh on one end which should provide great ventilation if pitched in wind direction.

The Akto is the 4-season model of the Enan and more suitable for harsh weather conditions than the Enan. It is a bit longer than the Enan and more suitable if you are taller. This comes at an additional weight of 600 grams. However, <a href="http://dzjow.com/2011/11/21/9-years-with-a-hilleberg-akto/">condensation</a> might be an issue with this tent (also reported <a href="http://www.backpacking.net/hilleberg-akto-review.html#condensation">here</a>) which is of course bad if you plan a longer tour with a down sleeping bag and you face a long period or rain or moisture where you are not able to dry your sleeping bag during the day. Another reason why I would opt for a bigger tent like the Anjan 2 or Unna if you need a 3-season tent because it's less likely that your sleeping bag touches the inner tent if you have more space.

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is a non-freestanding 1-2 person tent.
<br><br>
Fabric: Kerlon 600 <br>
Weight: 1.7 kg<br>
Area inner tent: 2.6m2 <br>
<br>
The Niak 1.5 is the latest yellow label tent from Hilleberg. If you need more space than in the Hilleberg Enan e.g. if there is a longer rain period where you have to sit in the tent. It can accommodate up to 2 persons and has a vestibule to store your gear. If you need a spacious 3-season tent for solo or 2-person use then the Niak 1.5 could be a good choice if you are looking for a tent with low weight.

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is a freestanding 2-person tent for 3 seasons.
<br><br>
Fabric: 20D ripstop /30D ripstop (floor) <br>
Weight: 1.7 kg<br>
Area inner tent: 2.7m2 <br>
<br>
The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is also a great 3-season tent. Compared to the Hilleberg Niak 1.5 it costs much less. However, the Hilleberg has a stronger floor material (50D). If you are low on budget then the MSR Hubba Hubba would be our pick. If you want a freestanding 4 season tent then go for the Hilleberg Unna.

This is currently our summer tent (even so I have the 3 person model). It's 700 grams more heavy than the Enan but you get lot's of space and may even use it with another person. Your sleeping bag is less likely to become wet (except at the foot end from my own experience but you can cover the foot part of your sleeping bag with your waterproof jacket. If you have to sit in the tent for a longer period then having more space is much more comfortable.

The Unna is completely freestanding. The advantage of the Unna is the big entrance which can be used as a panorama window and that you can create a vestibule by detaching one corner of the inner tent while still having enough space to sleep in it. The Unna can also be used as a 2 person tent but you may not have a lot of space. The Unna is a 4-season tent. Make sure that you get the Mesh inner tent for the Unna to get a much better ventilation when it's not snowing.

The Soulo is a solo expedition tent which can be used under very harsh condition. It's stronger than the Unna and has a designated vestibule, however the inner tent offers less space than the Unna. This tent could (like the Unna) be useful for sea kayaking or mountaineering as it is completely freestanding. It's a bit more heavy than the Unna. Personally, I prefer the Unna.

The Nallo is probably the best choice if you want a 4-season tent which offers the most space and a vestibule for the least weight. If you don't need a freestanding tent and the best weight / space ratio 4-season tent then you should pick the Nallo.

## Conclusion
There is no best all purpose tent especially if you are weight conscious. The Soulo seems to be the toughest tent for stormy weather and winter camping but comes with additional weight while the Enan could be the perfect summer hiking tent where strength is not that important. 

If you do both, summer and winter camping and weight is important for you then the best solution would be to get two tents - the Enan / Hubba Hubba NX for summer and the Soulo / Unna / Nallo for winter camping. If you do only 3-season backpacking in unexposed environment and you prefer some comfort then I would go for the Anjan 2 or the Niak 1.5 (especially if you are tall) as it offers more space and is stronger than the Enan.

Hilleberg recommended me to take a tent with Kerlon 1200 or 1800 if I would go into exposed environment or long duration trips. As I will use my tent mostly in Northern Scandinavia I would opt for the Hilleberg Unna as a solo tent. It has more space then the Soulo, is more versatile, weights less and also costs less. 

Personally, I would choose the Unna together with the Hilleberg Mesh Inner Tent to increase venting during the summer. With the inner mesh I should have the perfect spring/summer/autumn tent which can also handle strong winds but at the same time I would also be able to use it as a winter tent by using the standard inner tent of the Unna. 
However, If I would not prefer a freestanding 4-season tent then my choice would be the Hilleberg Nallo as a 4-season tent as it simply offers more space and a dedicated vestibule compared to the Unna.

Here is also an [article][2] about our packrafting trip in the Swedish mountains where we are using the MSR Hubba Hubba NX.
