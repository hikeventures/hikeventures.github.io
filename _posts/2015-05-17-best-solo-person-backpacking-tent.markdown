In this article I would like to give an overview about the best solo person backpacking tents available for 2015 / 2016 (personal view). I focus on Hilleberg tents as I already owned 2 Hillebegs in the past. I also added a MSR tent (which MSR provided us for testing) as I found it a good alternative which costs less than most of the Hilleberg tents. It's also important to know that each tent is made for a specific purpose so there is no one tent fits all purposes tent. Also it's worth to consider that a 1-person tent can be more heavy than a 2-person tent if you would distribute the weight of the 2-person tent over each person.

### Hilleberg Enan

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UZ8ZNDQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UZ8ZNDQ&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=XBQVK7AJ3UD7ESR7"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZ8ZNDQ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UZ8ZNDQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Length: 215 cm  
Width: 60 cm (95cm)   
Height: 95 cm  
Inner Space: 1.7 m²  
Vestibule: 0.8 m²  
Weight: 1100 grams 
Fabric:  Kerlon 600   

The Enan is the ultralight model of the Akto.  If you don't require much space and use your tent only during the warmer months (3-season) then the Enan might be a good option. This type of tent is good for fast pack and go. If you are more into base camping, are very tall or want to have more space e.g. during a longer period of rain then the Anjan 2 or the Unna would be a better choice. The Enan has a mesh on one end which should provide great ventilation if pitched in wind direction.

### Hilleberg Akto
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X2HQPY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003X2HQPY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=FCTXO35WV5CXK5P7"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B003X2HQPY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003X2HQPY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Length: 220 cm   
Width: 62 cm (90cm)   
Height: 93 cm   
Inner Space: 1.7 m²    
Vestibule: 0.8 m²    
Weight: 1700 grams   
Fabric:  Kerlon 1200   

The Akto is the 4-season model of the Enan and more suitable for harsh weather conditions than the Enan. It is a bit longer than the Enan and more suitable if you are taller. This comes at an additional weight of 600 grams. However, [condensation](http://dzjow.com/2011/11/21/9-years-with-a-hilleberg-akto/ "Codensation Hilleberg") might be an issue with this tent (also reported [here](http://www.backpacking.net/hilleberg-akto-review.html#condensation "condensation Hilleberg") which is of course bad if you plan a longer tour with a down sleeping bag and you face a long period or rain or moisture where you are not able to dry your sleeping bag during the day. Another reason why I would opt for a bigger tent like the Anjan 2 or Unna if you need a 3-season tent because it's less likely that your sleeping bag touches the inner tent if you have more space.

### Hilleberg Niak 1.5

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT52A08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01AT52A08&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=2JIQ4SO5RH5PZJXL"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01AT52A08&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B01AT52A08" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is a non-freestanding 1-2 person tent.

Fabric: Kerlon 600   
Weight: 1.7 kg   
Area inner tent: 2.6 m²  

The Niak 1.5 is the latest yellow label tent from Hilleberg. If you need more space than in the Hilleberg Enan e.g. if there is a longer rain period where you have to sit in the tent or if you want to take your dog with you. The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is more a 1 person than a 2-person tent and comes with a vestibule to store your gear. If you need a spacious solo 3-season tent then the Niak 1.5 could be a good choice if you are looking for a tent with low weight. Alternatively, I would choose the MSR Hubba Hubba NX which is also less pricey and offers slightly more room.

### Hubba Hubba NX
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G7H9CAY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00G7H9CAY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=EX4S5YFHURHMA3L5"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7H9CAY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00G7H9CAY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is a freestanding 2-person tent for 3 seasons.

Fabric: 20D ripstop / 30D ripstop (floor)   
Weight: 1.7 kg   
Area inner tent: 2.7 m²  

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is also a great 3-season tent. Compared to the Hilleberg Niak 1.5 it costs much less. However, the Hilleberg has a stronger floor material (50D). If you are low on budget then the MSR Hubba Hubba would be our pick. If you want a freestanding 4 season tent then go for the Hilleberg Unna.

### Hilleberg Anjan 2

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IU0XEW8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IU0XEW8&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=CJ3OYX574GJJ5DNZ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU0XEW8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00IU0XEW8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Length: 220 cm   
Width: 130 cm   
Height: 100 cm   
Inner Space: 2.8 m²    
Vestibule: 2.4 m²    
Weight: 1800 grams   
Fabric:  Kerlon 1000    

The Hilleberg Anjan was our summer tent (even so I have the 3 person model) before we replaced it with the MSR Hubba Hubba NX (see above) because we enjoyed the seperate entrances and vestibules which the NX offers. The Hubba Hubba NX also has an inner tent which offers you the possibility to look outside. For the Anjan you have to buy a seperate inner mesh. The Hilleberg Anjan is 700 grams more heavy than the Enan but you get lot's of space and may even use it as a 2-person tent. Your sleeping bag is less likely to become wet (except at the foot end from my own experience but you can cover the foot part of your sleeping bag with your waterproof jacket. If you have to sit in the tent for a longer period then having more space is much more beneficial in terms of comfort.

### Hilleberg Unna

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IU0UMSC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IU0UMSC&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=IH74WSYOYDCATOTX"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU0UMSC&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00IU0UMSC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Length: 230 cm   
Width: 110 cm   
Height: 100 cm   
Inner Space: 2.5 m²     
Vestibule: 0 m²    
Weight: 2200 grams   
Fabric:  Kerlon 1200   

The Unna is completely freestanding. The advantage of the Unna is the big entrance which can be used as a panorama window and that you can create a vestibule by detaching one corner of the inner tent while still having enough space to sleep in it. The Unna can also be used as a 2 person tent but you may not have a lot of space. The Unna is a 4-season tent. Make sure that you get the Mesh inner tent for the Unna to get a much better ventilation when it's not snowing.

### Hilleberg Soulo
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LAP3G6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LAP3G6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4R5WXJMR7LNA2MKY"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004LAP3G6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004LAP3G6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Length: 220 cm   
Width: 105 cm    
Height: 95 cm    
Inner Space: 2.0 m²    
Vestibule: 0.6 m²    
Weight: 2400 grams   
Fabric:  Kerlon 1200  

The Soulo is a solo expedition tent which can be used under very harsh condition. It's stronger than the Unna and has a designated vestibule, however the inner tent offers less space than the Unna. This tent could (like the Unna) be useful for sea kayaking or mountaineering as it is completely freestanding. It's a bit more heavy than the Unna. Personally, I prefer the Unna if you need a self-standing tent. If you don't need a self-standing 4-season tent then I would choose the MSR Hubba Hubba NX.

### Hilleberg Nallo
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMR6HSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMR6HSO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4YIQPTOP7VXOY4EM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMR6HSO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMR6HSO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Length: 220 cm   
Width: 130 cm   
Height: 100 cm   
Inner Space: 2.8 m²    
Vestibule: 1.3 m²     
Weight: 2400 grams    
Fabric:  Kerlon 1200  

The Nallo is probably the best choice if you want a 4-season tent which offers the most space and a vestibule for the least weight. If you don't need a freestanding tent and the best weight / space ratio 4-season tent then you should pick the Nallo.

## Conclusion
There is no best all purpose tent especially if you are weight conscious. The Soulo seems to be the toughest tent for stormy weather and winter camping but comes with additional weight while the Enan or the Niak could be the perfect summer hiking tent where strength and durability is less important. 

If you do both, summer and winter camping and weight is important for you then the best solution would be to get two tents - the Enan / Niak / Hubba Hubba NX for summer and the Soulo / Unna / Nallo for winter camping. If you do only 3-season backpacking in unexposed environment and you prefer some comfort then I would go for the Anjan 2 or the Niak 1.5 (especially if you are tall) as it offers more space and is stronger than the Enan.

Hilleberg recommended me to take a tent with Kerlon 1200 or 1800 if I would go into an exposed environment or on longer trips. As I will use my tent mostly in Northern Scandinavia I would opt for the Hilleberg Unna as a self-standing 4-season solo tent. It has more space then the Soulo, is more versatile, weights less and also costs less. For 3-season I would choose the Hilleberg Niak or the MSR Hubba Hubba NX.

If I would choose the Hilleberg Unna as a summer tent then I would replace the standard Mesh with the Hilleberg Mesh Inner Tent to increase venting during the summer. With the inner mesh I should have the perfect spring/summer/autumn tent which can also handle strong winds but at the same time I would also be able to use it as a winter tent by using the standard inner tent of the Unna. 

Please note that it's a good idea to have more space in your tent or a bigger vestibule if you are more into winter camping. For longer trips you should probably consider even bigger tents than the ones I have listed here.

Here is also an [article](http://www.hikeventures.com/-packrafting-Njuoreatnu-Tornetrask-abisko-day-2/ "Packrafting in Sweden") about our packrafting trip in the Swedish mountains where we are using the MSR Hubba Hubba NX.
