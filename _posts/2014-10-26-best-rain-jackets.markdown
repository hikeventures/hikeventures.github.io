Planning to go hiking, backpacking, running, cycling, mountaineering or on any other backcountry trip? Then you should have a lightweight rain jacket in your backpack to stay dry and warm on your adventure. Here is my buying guide of the best rain jackets for 2016. The rain jackets which I have selected below are sorted according to their weight and consist of rain jackets for men but in most cases there are also equivalent female rain jacket models available.

Konstantin wearing the [Montane Minimus Jacket](http://www.backcountry.com/montane-minimus-jacket-mens) on our [trip](http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Rain Jacket in Sarek Nationak Park") in the Sarek National Park in Sweden - also considered of being one of the last wilderness areas in Europe.

You might want to wear your waterproof jacket only occasionally e.g. if it starts raining or if it gets very windy but you will appreciate to stay dry and warm on the trail or if you perform any other outdoor activities in the long run.  Also consider taking lightweight waterproof [rain pants](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-rain-pants/ "Best Rain Pants 2016") with you.

### [Montane Minimus Jacket](http://www.backcountry.com/montane-minimus-jacket-mens)

 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SPCZW4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004SPCZW4&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=XQWBWNDOOIDSRSSU"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004SPCZW4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004SPCZW4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 208 grams   
**Fabric:**  PERTEX Shield +  

 The Montane Minimus Jacket is similar to the Montane Minimus Smock with the difference that it has an adjustable hoody and a long front zipper to easily put on / off the jacket. This can be an advantage if you are in the mountains and is suddenly starts to rain. It also features an fully adjustable helmet compatible mountain hood. 

I would choose the Montane Minimus Jacket as my go-to jacket if every gram counts and you want to have a full-zip jacket. If durability is also an important aspect then you should have a look at the new Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket which comes next in my list.

### [Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket](http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-zeta-lt-jacket-mens)

 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q837B50/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00Q837B50&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=Z43W3DTANP74O3MC"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q837B50&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00Q837B50" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 335 grams   
**Fabric:** N40p-X 3L GORE-TEX

The Zeta LT Jacket would be my favourite choice if I would select a new waterproof jacket. It comes with the new Gore Tex GORE C-KNIT backer technology which should be super comfortable on the skin and even more breathable. There is also a lighter jacket out which is called Norvan Jacket and comes with only 215 grams. However, I would not choose it for packrafting as the fabric N20p 3L is quite thin compared to the Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket. The Norvan jacket is more suitable for runners or if you don't wear a backpack.

Patrick filtering water with the [Katadyn Mini](http://www.backcountry.com/katadyn-mini-ceramic-microfilter) and wearing the [Montane Minimus Jacket](http://www.backcountry.com/montane-minimus-jacket-mens) on our [trip](http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Rain Jacket in Sarek Nationak Park") in the Sarek National Park in Sweden.

## Which fabric?
You should look for a rain jacket which is made of light fabrics. In terms of e.g. GORE-TEX, I would opt for GORE-TEX Active Shield or the new GORE C-KNIT backer technology which comes with the new Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket. However, you will sweat in all rain jackets if you are active regardless of the fabric.

### Rain jacket for winter
if you are planning to wear your jacket for skiing or snowboarding a more durable fabric like GORE-TEX ProShell or in certain cases also the GORE-TEX Active or GORE C-KNIT fabric would be more suitable rather than a thin Pertex Shield+ fabric because those fabrics are more durable.

### Rain jacket for summer
If you plan a hiking trip then I would recommend you to wear a [wind jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-windjackets/ "Wind Jackets") when it is not raining and switch to a rain jacket once it starts raining. At least this strategy has worked out best for me on my hiking trips even so I had to carry two jackets. However, a [wind jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-windjackets/ "Wind Jacket") is so light that you probably won't notice it in your backpack. 

If you are looking for a rain jacket for your next hiking trip then you should consider to get a lightweight rain jacket as you will probably have your rain jacket most of the time in your backpack (depending on the weather). I had good experience with the [Montane Minimus Jacket](http://www.backcountry.com/montane-minimus-jacket-mens) on the trail.
