For those folks who would like to keep track on where they hiked, biked etc. should have a look on GPS watches like the Suunto Ambit2. Sure, you can also do this with an app on your phone but personally I found it more comfortable to have a watch on my wrist. Having had the Suunto Ambit before the Suunto Ambit 2 also adds altitude GPS functionality and "Find back" support.

## Recommendation
I have used the Suunto Ambit2 on our trip in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">Sarek</a>  and it performed quite well. It was nice to see on the PC the route we hiked. However, it is advisable to take a spare battery with a USB connection with you if you go on a multiple day trip.
