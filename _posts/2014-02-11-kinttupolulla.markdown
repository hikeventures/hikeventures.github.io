<a href="http://kinttupolulla.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Kinttupolulla-blog</a> was born from love of nature, travels and sunshine. In the autumn 2012 I needed something to cheer up the darkening evenings in Finland and started blogging. I would like to spend the dark winters abroad in the sunlight, although I love Finnish summer really much. Ever since blogging has become an important hobby for me.

The essence of my blog is nature and hiking. I love long walks in the nature and could spend the whole day wandering around. I also write about my travels in general, but even though when I travel in town, I will seek the best viewpoints to climb or the best parks to have a picnic. As much I love nature, I love the animals that live in it. I am a vegan and in my travels I observe how animals are treated around the world. At home I have two lovely and demanding cats, which sometimes appear on my blog.<br><br>

At the moment I live in Andalusia Spain, which has great outdoors and stunning hiking paths at the mountains. In this place, I could live a bit longer…

All pictures are taken from Andalusia Spain! And by the way, I write my blog only in Finnish…
