A few weeks ago I received the Marmot Force UL 2P from Marmot to test it on my summer trip in Finnish Lapland. Once I received the tent I pitched it in our yard to pre-check if it would be suitable for my trip.

# Materials
My first thoughts were that the tent is very light but also found that one peg was missing and that a small piece of the inner tent mesh (about 1cm2) was a bit damaged. However as I received the tent for testing it was ok but I was not sure if this tent will survive 1 week in the wilderness. The fabric is quite thin and I was considering using an additional floor sheet under the tent to avoid getting holes into the tent floor. Weight is of course a marketing feature but I would rather carry a few more grams with me rather than having a less durable tent.

That's how it looks like when you lie in the Marmot tent. There were plenty of mosquitoes on my trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/).

# Pitching the tent
I pitched the tent without using any manual as I piteched already quite many tents in the past. I would say that it is quite easy to pitch the tent once you know in which direction the long pole should go and once you find the markings on the outer tent to set it up into the right direction. The tent only requires 6 pegs. There are also velcro straps on the outer tent to attach them to the poles. Pitching the tent a second time was much faster once I knew how to set it up correctly.

# Field testing
I was testing the Marmot Force UL 2P on a one week trip in Finnish Lapland and in Norway at the Arctic Sea. It was raining every night and in Norway we had strong wind. I was not sure if the Marmot tent could handle the strong wind but I was able to sleep in it the whole night without any issues.

I used the pocket over my head to store my ear plugs.

# Negative
* Outer tent is not self standing. Not possible to remove inner tent from outer tent when it's raining.
* The foot part could be a bit higher but it's sufficient.
* Inner tent mesh is a bit fragile.

---

# Positive
* Can handle stronger wind but I would probably get a stronger tent if I were planning to go to a very exposed area.
* The Inner tent is self-supporting (pegs needed to create proper room in the tent)
* Two vestibules to store a lot of gear. Also allows entrance and exit from both sides of the tent.
* Air flow is quite good.
* Tent hight is ok to sit in it.
* Space for additional gear inside the inner tent.
* Many pockets inside the tent to store your phone or earplugs.
* Big side windows on both sides for panorama view.
* Tent floor seems to be quite durable. No holes after a one week trip in Finnish Lapland and Norway.
* Inner tent is made of mesh which allows star gazing if used without the outer tent.

I liked that the inner tent was made completely of mesh.

# Conclusion
I would recommend the Marmot Force UL 2P if you use it occasionally. I liked the weight, the panorama windows on both sides and that there is enough space for your gear under the vestibules. I also did not get any holes in the tent floor during my one week trip. The air flow was also ok with both outer tent doors closed but was even better when slightly opened. The mesh of the inner tent seems to be a bit fragile and should be improved to increase the durability of the tent as it looked a bit damaged after a few days. Apart from that I was quite happy with the tent.
