description: Review of the Marmot Force UL 2P

A few weeks ago I received the Marmot Force UL 2P from Marmot to test it on my summer trips in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/) and [Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/Finnmark/). I was interested in the Marmot Force UL 2P as I was looking for a light 3-season solo tent which can also handle winds on the Norwegian coast.

# Initial thoughts
My first thoughts were that the tent is very light but also found that one peg was missing and that a small piece of the inner tent mesh (about 1 cm2) was a bit distorted and I was a bit worried that the inner tent may not survive 1 week in the wilderness. The fabric of the tent is quite thin and I was considering using an additional tent footprint under the tent to avoid getting holes into the tent floor. However, I decided to use the tent without the additional tent footprint. Weight is of course a marketing feature but I would rather carry a few more grams with me rather than having a less durable tent.

That's how it looks like when you lie in the Marmot tent. There were plenty of mosquitoes on my trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/).

# Field testing
I was testing the Marmot Force UL 2P on a one week trip in Finnish Lapland and in Northern Norway at the coast of the Arctic Sea. It was raining every night and in Norway we had strong winds. We always tried to pitch our tents in the direction of the wind nearby the coast on a more wind protected area but the wind was still considerably strong. At one point the tent got a bit flat so I would probably not pitch the tent on a very exposed area with strong winds. However, I was able to sleep comfortably in the tent one week without having any issues. The loops in the inner tent allowed me to put a cord through them to dry clothes. Apart from the normal tent bag I also used a stuff bag to minimize the size of the tent in my backpack while carrying the pegs and the poles seperately.

# Pitching the tent
I pitched the tent the first time without using any manual as I piteched already quite many tents in the past. I would say that it is quite easy to pitch the tent. I only struggled a bit to lay the outer tent into the right direction on top of the inner tent because I did not notice the markings on the outer tent. The tent only requires 6 pegs so pitching the tent goes relatively fast. There are also several velcro straps on the outer tent to attach the outer tent properly to the poles. Pitching the tent a second time was much faster once I knew how to set it up correctly.

I used the pocket over my head to store my ear plugs.

# Positive
* Can handle stronger winds if pitched correctly.
* The Inner tent is self-supporting (pegs needed to create proper room in the tent)
* Two vestibules to store a lot of gear. 
* Two doors allows entrance and exit from both sides of the tent.
* It's possible to sit in the tent.
* Space for additional gear next to the sleeping pad.
* Many pockets on the inner tent to store your phone or earplugs.
* Big side windows on both sides for panorama view and air ventilation.
* Tent floor seems to be quite durable. No holes after a one week trip in Finnish Lapland and Norway.
* Inner tent is completely made of mesh which allows star gazing if used without the outer tent.
* Several loops in the inner tent to attach a rope.

---

# Negative
* Outer tent is not self standing. Not possible to first remove inner tent from the outer tent when it's raining to keep the inner tent dry.
* Inner tent mesh is a bit fragile and distortes easily.
* Pegs could be of better quality / lighter.

I liked that the inner tent was made completely of mesh.

# Conclusion
I would recommend the Marmot Force UL 2P if you need a light 3-season solo tent. I liked the weight, the panorama windows on both sides and that there is enough space for your gear under the vestibules. I also did not get any holes in the tent floor during my one week trip. The air flow was also ok with both outer tent doors closed but was even better when slightly opened. The mesh of the inner tent seems to be a bit fragile and should be improved to increase the durability of the tent as the inner mesh tent looked a bit damaged after a few days. Apart from that I was quite happy with the tent.
