For my next snowshoeing trip in Lapland I was looking for a new pair of gloves or mittens to replace my old gloves which were "nothing special" compared to the ones presented in this buying guide.

It always takes time to find the right product and everyone has a different taste on features or design so I decided to come up with a list of winter gloves / mittens from different brands which received good recommendations.

## Gloves or Mittens?
Gloves give you more dexterity (that's the magic selling word in the world of goves manufactures) than mittens. However, mittens keep your fingers warmer than gloves.

Gloves and mittens allow you to layer. Layering is an important aspect for everyone interested in outdoor activities and a liner glove can be regarded as the underwear for your fingers. If you need additional warmth add a merino liner glove under your regular glove and your fingers will feel warmer.

There is also an option from Hestra available - the [Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove](http://www.backcountry.com/hestra-heli-3-finger-glove "Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove") - which sits in between mitts and gloves are probably also a good option for example if you need to handle a camera. This model is my favourite model of all gloves in this list. 

However, you can also just take your main gloves off and operate your camera by just wearing the liner gloves. Once you have taken your picture you just put your main gloves back over the merino liner gloves.

### [Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove](http://www.backcountry.com/hestra-heli-3-finger-glove)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0153QFDXO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0153QFDXO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=5RNHLQHTIVZ7K3GF"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0153QFDXO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0153QFDXO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove comes with a removeable liner and is wind- and waterproof. The Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove has also a pre-curved design. One free-moving finger is just sufficient to operate for example a camera while the other fingers stay warm as in a mitten. If I were to buy new gloves then I would probably buy these gloves. There is also the [Hestra Heli Ergo Grip Glove](http://www.backcountry.com/hestra-heli-ergo-grip-glove) available if you prefer to have a regular glove.

The Canada Goose Down Mittens are water- and windproof and filled with 525 Fill Power White Goose Down and come with a Velcro closure for wrist cinch, hardface fleece cuffs and glove clips. The only downside on the Canada Goose Down Mittens is that they don't have a removeable liner.

## Best Winter Gloves for Skiing, Snowboarding or Snowshoeing

### [Canada Goose Down Glove](http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-down-glove-mens)

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00508I2MA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00508I2MA&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=F566HJCK2RAS3XIB"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00508I2MA&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00508I2MA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Canada Goose Down Gloves are similar to the Canada Goose Down Mitten and probably a better choice if you need to use your fingers a lot. However, they will be not as warm as the Canada Goose Down Mitten and they also do not come with a removeable glove liner.

The North Face Patrol Gloves are waterproof and come with a lining and PrimaLoft insulation. The North Face Patrol Gloves are probably not that warm as the Down filled gloves from Canada Goose.

##Conclusion
My personal preference goes towards the [Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove](http://www.backcountry.com/hestra-heli-3-finger-glove "Hestra Army Leather Heli 3-Finger Glove"). I need to have one finger freely moving around to control my camera without having to take off my gloves all the time. At the same time this glove keeps the fingers warm which I don't need to operate my camera. However, if you are looking for the ultimate in warmth then you should probably go for real mittens.
