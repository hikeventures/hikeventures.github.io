Looking for an ultralight quilt for the summer for your next hiking, backpacking, camping or any other backcountry adventure? Have a look at the Katabatic Gear Chisos. This quilt can be used for degrees around 40 F / +5 C and higher or you can layer up inside and use it for lower temperatures. Personally, I felt a bit cold when I used this quilt in August here in Finland when we had around +6 C in the night even so I was wearing jogging pants and a long sleeved merino shirt. I would just use this quilt for June and July here in Finland but it depends if you are a warm or a cold sleeper. In general, this is a high quality quilt.<br><br>

##Features
The Katabatic Gear Chisos Quilt comew with 900 cuin down, a water repellent pertex quantum shell, YKK zippers and weights around 14.6 oz. It's a high quality quilt which can be used during the summer months or as an additional layer during colder months. I also liked the customer service offered by Katabatic.<br><br>

Those straps are going below the sleeping pad. It keeps the quilt on its place and helps to 'seal' the sides against cold air coming into the quilt.<br><br>

##Recommendation
The Katabatic Gear Chisos is a minimalistic high quality quilt. This quilt serves well during the warmer days during the year or as an additional layer when it's cold. However, I prefer using sleeping bags as there is always a risk that cold air could flow in on the sides in case you are turning while you are sleeping. Personally, I prefer taking a sleeping bag on my trips (like the [Cumulus Panyam](http://hikeventures.com/cumulus-panyam-450/) and use the quilt during the colder months as an additional layer.
