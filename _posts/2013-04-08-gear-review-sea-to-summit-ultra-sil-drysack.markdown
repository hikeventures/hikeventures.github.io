Recently, I purchased a new backpack and was in need of getting a dry sack where I can stuff my clothes etc. in to keep them dry in case of rain while on the trail. So I took a look on the Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Drysack for my next hiking, backpacking and packrafting trips and here is a short review.

## Features
The Sea to Summit Ultra Sil Drysack is durable, packs small and weights only 50 grams.

I decided to go for the cordura version of the Sea to Summit Dry Sacks. Even so they are a couple of grams more heavy than their non-cordura brothers, I felt it's worth having a sack which is a little more durable since my non-cordura sack died already after the second trip. This 20 litre pack weights 50 grams and has won the Backpacker Editor's Choice award in 2006.

## Recommendation
I have tested the Sea to Summit Ultra Sil Drysack on <a href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">our trip to Sarek</a> in Sweden and those drysacks performed quite well to keep our clothes dry. Alternatively, I would also recommend the Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Compression Sack which I prefer even more. It weights 136 grams but you will be able to pack gear like down sleeping bag or down jackets really small.
