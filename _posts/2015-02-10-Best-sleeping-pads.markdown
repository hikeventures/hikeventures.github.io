In this blog post you can find the best sleeping pads available in 2016. I have sorted the sleeping pads by their weight and not by performance and also indicated the R-value of each sleeping pads so you can choose the one which would be most suitable for your next outdoor adventure. From my selection of the best sleeping pads I have only tested the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm, Therm-a-Rest Evolite and the Exped SYNMAT UL 7 M (you can [see](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/) the SYNMAT UL 7 M in action on our hiking and packrafting trip in the Swedish Mountains).

# How to choose the best sleeping pad?

* Weight (do you want an ultralight sleeping pad?)
* Size (does it need to pack small?)
* Pad for summer, winter, or 4-season?
* Sleeping area (do I need a bigger size because I am a big guy?)
* Ease of inflate / deflate
* Is weight more important to me than comfort?
* Durability (a thinner fabric may be less durable / may not be that puncture resistant)
* Do I want to have a  inflatable mattress, a self-inflating pad or a camping foam?
* Are the edges of the pad supportive?
* Does the pad slip easily in the tent?
* Does the pad make noise when I sleep on it (ear plugs might help)?

## R-value and Season 
The R-value of a Sleeping Pad indicates the thermal resistance of a sleeping pad. The higher the R-Value the more the sleeping pad is capable to keep you warm during cold nights. For summer and late spring / early autumn I would opt for a sleeping pad with an R-value between 2.0-3.0 depending on the location. For winter camping I would rather go for a sleeping pad with an R-Value of around 5 or more. I have a sleeping pad with an R-value of 3.3 which I have tested at around 0 degree Celsius during the night and I felt the cold. I guess that a sleeping pad with a R-value of around 4 would have been more suitable for this temperature.

---

## Air and hand pumps / Inflators
Some sleeping pad manufacturers also selling [air pumps](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sleeping+pads+pump) for their sleeping pads. Inflating your sleeping pad with an air pump is the most convenient way but adds to the weight of your backpack depending if you use a mechanical air pump or a plastic pump sack.

---

## Alternatives
If you are looking for an alternative to your sleeping pad then you could either collect a lot of moss or use any gear which you are carrying with you and could server as a sleeping pad. Just be aware that the insulation might be not that efficient than with a regular sleeping pad. You should probably test such alternatives in your backyard before heading to more remote places.

---

## Brands / Manufacturers
There are several brands designing sleeping pads. Some examples are:

* [ALPS Mountaineering](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=alps+mountaineering+pad)
* [Big Agnes](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=big+agnes+pads)
* [Eureka](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=eureka+pads)
* [Exped](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=exped+pads)
* [NEMO Equipment Inc.](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=nemo+pads)
* [Sea To Summit](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sea+to+summit+pads)
* [Therm-A-Rest](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=thermarest+pads)
* [Vaude](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=vaude+pads)

---

## Dimensions
Before you decide on buying a sleeping pad you should measure the dimensions of e.g. you tent. Some sleeping pads are different in their width and length and you may not be able to fit your sleeping pad into your tent. Also make sure that your sleeping pad is long enough.

---

## Durability
The durability of a sleeping pad depends on how you treat your pad and how often you use it. The durability can be different for every brand and model. Ultralight sleeping pads wear off much faster than regular sleeping pads since they are made of thinner and lighter materials. 

---

## Down
[Winter sleeping pads](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=winter+sleeping+pad) are sometimes filled with down or covered with a thermal foil layer to increase the insulation. 

---

## Dry or stuff sack
To keep your sleeping pad dry you can stuff it into a [dry sack](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=dry+sack). There is usually also a dry sack included when you buy a sleeping pad.

---

## Foam
If you want to be on the safe side then you should buy a sleeping pad which is made of foam as it can not get any punctures. They might be less cosy to sleep on so you might look for a soft camping ground. The [Therm-a-Rest Lite SOL](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad) is a popular foam sleeping pad.

---

## Side sleeper
If you are a side sleeper or turn around while sleeping then you should probably get a wider sleeping pad. The [NeoAirs](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=neoair) are popular sleeping pads. 

---

## Hiking vs camping
When comparing [hiking](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?q=camping sleeping pads) vs [camping](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?q=hiking sleeping pads) then you could select a lighter sleeping pad when you are hiking and a more comfortable and probably heavier one when you only plan to go camping. 

---

## Sleeping pad for baby
Some manufacturers also offer [sleeping pads for kids](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=kid+sleeping+pads) but you can also just use a [regular sized](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sleeping+pads) sleeping pad.

---

## Grip
Some sleeping pads have less grip than others which may cause them to slip around in the tent more than other pads.

---

## Repair glue / Repair kit / Patch kit
Most sleeping pads come with a repair kit (or patch kit) which includes a repair glue. You can also [purchase](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sleeping+pads+repair+glue) them separately.

---

## Hammock
You can use your sleeping pad also in a hammock to increase insulation. 

---

## Insulation (r-value)
The r-value indicates the insulation of a sleeping pad. Down or a thermal foil can also add to the insulation and are usually found on winter sleeping pads.

---

## Lightweight
Sleeping pads should be lightweight if you are planning to go on a hiking trip. I found the [Therm-A-Rest XTherm](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-sleeping-pad) a good compromise between insulation and weight.

---

## Length & Width
Sleeping pads come in different length and width. Choose the one which comes closer to your length. Choose a wide sleeping pad if you move around while sleeping or if you are a big person.

---

## Leak
If your sleeping pad is leaking because you got a puncture then you should fix it with a [repair kit](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=repaid+kit+sleeping+pad) or buy a new sleeping pad.

---

## Material
Sleeping pads are usually made of foam or plastic.

---

## Memory foam
Some sleeping pads are made of memory foam which moulds to a warm body.

---

## Most comfortable sleeping pad
The most comfortable sleeping pad is usually more heavy and thicker. Also here it depends on your needs. A sleeping pad can be super comfortable but it may be a trade off if you have to carry your heavy and comfortable sleeping pad the whole day.

---

## Non inflatable pads
Non-inflatable sleeping pads are the safest pads for back-country adventures. They can't get any puncture but they are not as comfortable as inflatable pads.

---

## Noisy sleeping pads
Some sleeping pads may be more noisy to sleep on especially if they have an insulation foil as a thermal layer. A good solution towards noisy sleeping pads are ear plugs.

---

## How to attach on a backpack
A sleeping pad can be attached on the backpack. A good spot is either on the side or on the top of the backpack.

---

## Sheet
If you prefer to have your sleeping pad like your bed at home then you could cover your sleeping pad with a [sheet](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sleeping+pad+sheet).

---

## Self inflating
[Self-inflating sleeping pads](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sleeping+pad+self-inflating) have a special foam which do not require you to inflate the pad yourself. One disadvantage of a self-inflating sleeping pad is the additional weight which comes with such a foam.

---

## Side sleeper
If you are a side sleeper then you should look out for a wider sleeping pad like the [Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-max-sleeping-pad).

---

## Storage
On the trail you can store your sleeping pad in a stuff sack. Usually, I just use the stuff sack to store my sleeping pad at home.

---

## Thickness
The thickness of a sleeping pad is also (but not only) an indication on how well a pad insulates.

---

## Types
There are three types of sleeping pads available: self-inflating foam-and-air, inflatable and closed-cell foam pads.

---

## Temperature rating
The temperature rating of a sleeping pad depends on the thickness, filling, insulation foil or foam of a pad and is usually indicated by the r-value.

---

## Ultralight
Some brands offer ultralight sleeping pads. Their size is probably optimized or they use lighter materials. My favourite ultralight 4-season sleeping pad is the [Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-max-sleeping-pad).

---

## Sleeping Pad vs inflatable air mattress
A foam sleeping pad might be less comfortable and bulky than a air mattress however a foam mattress is a safer option agains punctures compared to an air mattress.

---

## Valve replacement or valve repair
Some sleeping pad manufacturers offer [valve repair kids](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=sleeping+pad+valve) which you can purchase additionally.

---

## Pillow
Some manufacturers are also selling [inflatable air pillows](http://www.backcountry.com/Store/catalog/search.jsp?s=u&q=air+pillow). You can also use spare clothes as an alternative to an air pillow.  

---

## Winter sleeping pads
Winter sleeping pads are usually thicker and have a special insulation like down or a foil which increases their r-value. One of my favourite winter sleeping pads is the [Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-max-sleeping-pad)

---

## Weight limit
There is no weight limit on sleeping pads. You have to decide yourself how much comfort you want and if it's worth to carry it.

---

## Personal experience
I found my Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm more comfortable than my EXPED SYNMAT UL 7 M and it insulates more while being lighter. I found the Therm-a-rest more comfortable because of it's surface pattern. I just don't get along with those vertically grooves on the EXPED. I also found that the Therm-a-rest is more stable to sleep on. Having said that, it's still possible to sleep on the EXPED depending on your own preference. Below the surface of the EXPED Synmat UL 7 M compared to the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm. 

However, the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm is a bit more expensive than the SYNMAT UL 7 M. What I like on the SYNMAT is that it is easy to inflate and deflate. For the Therm-a-rest it took me a little bit longer because of the smaller valve compared to the EXPED. Since I found the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm a reference model for cold temperatures, I didn't include any other sleeping pads which are more heavy except the Therm-a-Rest EvoLite since it is a self-inflating pad for the warmer months. If I would go on a trip then my preference would go towards the Therm-a-rest XTherm - which is the best sleeping pad in my opinion.
