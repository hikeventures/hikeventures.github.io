Repovesi National Park is Southern Finland's most popular hiking destination and you can get there by public transport within 2 hours from Helsinki. The National Park offers plenty of lakes and hills. There are campsites and shelters and it is located nearby the city of Kouvola and accessible by public transportation.

This is the main entrance to Repovesi National Park. We actually left the park from here as we went to far with the bus and entered the National Park from another spot.

##  Sights
The Olhavanvuori Rock is 50 m high and glows on sunny days in different colors. It has prehistoric rock paintings and is perfect for climbers.

From Mustalamminvuori we had a great scenic view over the National Park.

Of course we had to climb up this observation tower in Mustavuori in order to enjoy the scenery.

And the awesome view we got from the hanging bridge.

With the fox ferry we pulled ourselves to the other side of the lake.

The Kuutinkanava Canal which was built in 1912 to float logs is 270 m long

Navigation in the Repovesi National Park is quite easy since trails are marked.

This well provided fresh water and was a welcome alternative to our water which we <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-katadyn-mini-water-filter/" target="_self">filtered</a>  from the river.

There are also plenty of refuges in Repovesi. We had a break at this one before we left the National Park.

In my opinion, Repovesi National Park is more enjoyable than <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-in-nuuksio-national-park-finland/" target="_self">Nuuksio</a>  and it is less crowded too. On the way back to Kouvola we hitchhiked and someone picked us up just after 10 minutes standing on the road. Repovesi National Park is definitely worth a visit.
