Last February we went to Lapland for some cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, ice swimming and extreme fell sledding. Here is the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/">article</a> which I posted back then and now we have also a short video :)
