On my last trip to Germany I was visiting
the Pfahlbaum museum in Unteruhldingen at
the Lake of Constance which is an
UNESCO World Heritage site. The original
houses has been build around 4000 BC and 850 BC.

The museum consists of reconstructions of
stilt houses from the Bronze and Stone age
as well as a cinematic introduction which is
available to every visitor participating in
the guided tour (which is included in the
ticket price). The artefacts which are displayed in the museum
have been found all over the area.

During the guided tour I have learned that
such constructions have been built all over
the area. Water was considered as the best
way to travel and to transport goods at this
time as most of the area was covered by dense
forest. The lake of constance was considerably
smaller during that time and temperatures were
similar to mediterranean climate.

Having a steady home also meant that it's
inhabitants had to do farming. Salt was
used to preserve food and bronze metal was
the raw material to create all kind of weapons
and tools during the bronze age.

The price for the ticket was 9 EUR and I found
the pricing reasonable since a guided tour is
included in the price.
