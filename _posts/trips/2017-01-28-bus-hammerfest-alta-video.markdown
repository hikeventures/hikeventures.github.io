On our trip to Norway we decided to go for a day trip from Alta to Hammerfest. We bought the tickets from <a href="http://www.northadventure.no">North Adventure</a>. The bus just left from the front of their office and the whole bus trip took around 3 hours including a 1 hour break where we had to switch the buses. Here is our  video from this trip.
