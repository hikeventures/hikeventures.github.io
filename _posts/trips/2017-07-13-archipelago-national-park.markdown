The last 3 days I have been on a bicylce trip in the Archipelago National Park. This year I decided to travel along a new route which might probably replace the old route which [I have traveled](http://www.hikeventures.com/archipelago-trail/) last year with my bicycle. There were two major differences - namely there were more services on the way but it was also more expensive to travel the new route. The new route goes from Turku to Pensar, Korpoström, Aspö, [Örö](http://www.hikeventures.com/Oro/)(which I also visited last year with my packraft) and then back to Kasnäs where you can either take the bus (around 20 EUR) or cycle back to Turku (around 90 km).

## Turku to Pensar

After I picked up [Caj](https://www.hutkai.fi) we cycled along the Archipelago route from Turku to Granvik where we were supposed to take our first ferry to the Pensar island,

On the way to Granvik we stopped at the Resturant Sattmark in Prainen where we had a fantastic lunch - Caj ordered ripps and a beer and I (Patrick) had a goat cheese salad. There was also a café, gift shop, and a guest pier at this location. However, since we had only 1 hour time we were focusing more on our lunch.

From Parainen it was just another 8 km trip to the harbor in Granvik where the ferry transported us free of charge to Pensar. The ferry stopped on several other places on islands during the trip where people left and entered the ferry m/s Viken. There was no possibility to buy coffee, tea or any refreshments on board but the ferry was also rather small.

Sailing was definitely a popular activity at that day as the sea was quite crwoded with sailing boats.

Once we reached Pensar we cycled along an unpaved road until we reached Pensar Syd where we stayed over night.

The balcony in front of our house. This building was a gas station in former times.

A house at Pensar Syd decorated with a fishing net.

A place to rest and sit in front of the museum. In the background are the steps up to the monument. The area was also used by the Lotta organization (a civil guard for women) during the second world war. I have also visited the [Lotta museum](http://www.hikeventures.com/museums-in-tuusula/) in Järvenpää in the past.

The museum from outside.

The museum of Pensar Syd can be visited free of charge. It displays objects and pictures from the period of the second world war. Handicrafts can also be purchased here.

The monument at Pensar Syd. In the background a soccer field. There were also 2 saunas, grill place and a dartboard available for guests.

After a swim in the sea we rested 1 hour and had dinner (which was excellent). Afterwards, we hiked up to the monument and the top of the hill behind it where we had a great view over the archipelago.

On the way back to our room we had a chat with our host and she explained us that buildings like the museum are not typical for the archipelago area. We asked our host to pack our breakfast into a plastic bag as the ferry was leaving quite early.

## Pensar to Korpoström
The next day Caj's phone was rining and woke us up. We packed our stuff and cycled to the nearby harbor on the other end of the island where we landed the day before. At the harbor was also the collection site for trash and a small hut with the timetable of the ferry. Caj said that it's a good idea to make a reservation with the ferry beforehand as it may not operate if there are not customers.

The ferry was again free of charge and once on board we had our breakfast and a cup of tea which was available for 1 EUR on board. Once we reached our destination with the ferry we cycled to Nagu where we bought more breakfast and snacks at the local grocery store. From there it was another 25 km ride to Korpoström where we stayed over night in the Saaristokeskus. The hotel also featured an exhibition, sauna and a guest harbor. Moreover, there was also a small shop. The prices of the restaurant where a bit on the upper ranke (e.g. broccoli soup for 15 EUR or a Variery of Tomatoes for 10.90 EUR) but the quality was good.

After lunch we went to the Sauna and had a swim in the sea. Metsähallitus (local forest organization from the goverment) also meassured the water quality as can be seen below.

The breakfast at the Saaristokeskus in Korpoström. Croissants, porrage, cheese, eggs, ... we did not leave hungry.

## Korpoström to Aspö

After breakfast M/S Amanda from Aspö Charter picked us up to bring us to Aspö where we had a stopover and then to Örö. A one way ticket including bicycle costs 75 EUR and the trip takes about 3 hours. There was also a possibility to buy coffee, tea and buns on board and the crew was really nice.

Aspö is a small island with 11 inhabitants on it. There is also a samll church and a local store where you can buy local handicarfts and snacks.

It's a typical fishermen village. I asked one of the inhabitants what they are doing here during the winter and she said that they always find something to do.

A model ship inside of the church. Having such ship models in a church is very common in the archipelago area.

## Aspö to Örö

Once we left Aspö towards Örö we had plenty of time taking pictures and videos.

Three wind mills in the background to generate electricity.

Ships use those signs to navigate through the archipelago.

And then we arrived in Örö. Örö is a fortress island and has been open to the public since 2014. Here a canon and the radar tower.

Since we had only 4 hours time to spend on the island we decided to bicycle from the Northern to the Southern tip and back to save some time.

The flora and fauna on Örö is quite unique.

The Bengtskärs light house which is about 10 km away from Örö can be seen in the distance. Here I used the Telezoom to get a bit closer. The canon on Örö has been used to defend the light house when it got attacked by the Russian army during the second world war.
