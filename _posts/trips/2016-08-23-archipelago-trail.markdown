Last Friday I was cycling from Turku along the Archipelago Trail - a 250 km trip around the Turku Archipelago. The whole bicycle trip took me 27 hours to complete and I spent 1 night in my tent nearby the ferry harbour leaving from Kustavi. I have planned this summer bicycle trip already a long time ago but never had time to cycle it. I am also interested to do a bicycle tour in Åland but this won't happen this year anymore. Below you can see my Surly Disc Trucker on a bridge in Turku. I just bought a pair of [Ortlieb Back Roller Classics](https://www.rei.com/product/885299/ortlieb-back-roller-classic-panniers-pair) a week ago as well.

My first stop was the church in Raisio.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28507744483/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8298/28507744483_4bcd1c9d03_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie Raisio Church"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then the trail continued over the Särkänsalmen Silta (bridge).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28504585774/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8887/28504585774_a441ba3413_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie Särkänsalmen Silta"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From the Särkänsalmen Silta (bridge) I had a nice view over the sea. There were so many bridges on this trail that you don't have to rush to get a good picture from any of those bridges.

Then I came across a bird tower just after Raisio and I decided to explore it a bit.

Those signs on the road could be found along the Archipelago Trail and it's a good idea to have them there so you know that you are on the right track.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28507782673/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8195/28507782673_a0c50548b2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The neoclassical Askaisten Church was the next highlight on the Archipelago trail which dates back form the 17th century and was the chapel of the Louhisaari Manor where the Mannerheim family used to live. The church is also part of the oldest tourist route in Finland - the Seven Churches Tour.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28839812670/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8394/28839812670_68b412cb50_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie Askaisten Church Kirkko"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Just next to the Askaisten Church is the 'Askaisten Ritaripuisto' - or The Knights' Park which was founded in 2007 to honor the Finnish war veterans. The stone shows the Mannerheim Cross.

My trip continued to Kustavi along fields and bridges. Fortunately, the full moon lightened up the night so it was not too dark to cycle. The road felt a bit dangerous to cycle during the night as there were quite a few cars passing by with very high speed. Once I arrived nearby the Hepponiemi ferry at 12 pm I decided to pitch my [Marmot Force UL 2P](http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-force-ul-2p-tent-2-person-3-season) tent (which Marmot provided me for my trips this year) nearby the street as the first ferry was about to leave at around 8 am.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29093763286/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8503/29093763286_3847971a3d_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The Archipelago Trail | Saariston Rengastie moon"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The next morning I woke up at 7 am. I packed my [tent](http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-force-ul-2p-tent-2-person-3-season) and my other gear into my [Ortlieb Backroller Classic](https://www.rei.com/product/885299/ortlieb-back-roller-classic-panniers-pair) bags and cycled to the harbour.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28842099470/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8705/28842099470_3c65eed5dc_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Marmot Force UL 2P Surly Disc Trucker"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When I arrived in Hepponimi harbour there were already quite a few cars queuing to get onto the ferry to Iniö. There were only 2 others with their bicycles. Once I went on board I discovered that there was also a cafe. Unfortunately, it was closed during the whole trip. Transportation however was free of charge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28506866934/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8021/28506866934_996e32eeef_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö finnferry hepponimi"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Looking backwards from the ferry. Hepponimi - the place where the ferry left.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051627881/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8134/29051627881_2022336dcb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Kustavi Iniö ferry Aura"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On the way from Hepponimi to Kannvik. It felt a bit cold and windy but I always like to be on the sea and really enjoyed it.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29128759995/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7529/29128759995_df1a040f06_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Kustavi Iniö harbour satama Kannvik Hepponiemi"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At Kannvik harbour were only a few cars queuing for the ferry.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28506859034/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8165/28506859034_f0e87235d2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Kustavi Iniö aura ferry"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Once I arrived in Kannvik I cycled straight to the next ferry point. There were no significant sights or attractions on the way.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28506855134/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8148/28506855134_31e4c6b61e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö ferry"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Need to get to the other site with the ferry? Just push the button to call the ferry. Great service!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28842072680/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8082/28842072680_9f314c2849_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie ferry Iniö"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051614571/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8090/29051614571_40699ea003_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie farm "></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There was a "traffic light" mounted on the ferry which showed which cars could leave from which lane.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29023378532/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8234/29023378532_b65c6280ec_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö farm house"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

An old farm house nearby Iniö. The old car in front of it was quite interesting.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28506832494/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8199/28506832494_fa8f6dd16d_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö church"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Iniö church was built in the 18th century.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29023364902/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7770/29023364902_550eb33607_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö church kirkko"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A sailing ship hanging from the ceiling of the church - a quite common feature accross the churches in this region (also in Sweden).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29023360032/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8044/29023360032_5489938570_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö church"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Distances shown in Iniö. I followed the direction to the Lanthandel Kauppa to have my breakfast.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051579421/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8495/29051579421_1ff2625ee7_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö signs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Maypoles were also a common feature on the Archipelago trail.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29128743345/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8374/29128743345_47d13e9abd_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie maypole Iniö"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At Iniö Landhandel I had my breakfast. A group of motorcycle riders from the previous ferry were also there. I ordered tea and had a pastry - also called Wiener in Finland.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28506793244/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8038/28506793244_4a8eca0dba_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Iniö Landhandel"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At Iniö were ferries leaving to two different locations - I took the one to Houtskari.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29128734415/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8148/29128734415_fc2da6b704_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie ferry Houtskari Iniö"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I paid 15 EUR to get with my bicycle onto the ferry. There was also a cafe on board.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29128727135/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8476/29128727135_134daa6531_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie ferry Houtskari Iniö"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And I saw so many sailing ships on my bicycle trip.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051553541/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8577/29051553541_e5b075aa63_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie ferry Houtskari Iniö sailing ship"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then we arrived in Mossala and the Mossala Island Resort was probably "the place to sleep" on this island.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051546501/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8609/29051546501_5b664bb71c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Mossala Island Resort Harbour"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Again there was a nice maypole and an old windmill. I have seen the same kind of windmill already on different places in Western Finland.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28509862783/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8544/28509862783_9965aad2da_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Mossala windmill maypole"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29023299892/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8288/29023299892_57dcfb3eae_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Mossala wind mill"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The next ferry went from Mossala to Björkö. Again free of charge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051519871/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7631/29051519871_a2e0711aa7_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Mossala Farm"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At 1 pm I felt a bit hungry and decided to have lunch in the Pub Pelago.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29051504761/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8108/29051504761_7d905dad5b_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Björkö Pub Pelago"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I ordered a Halloumi salad and paid 9.80 EUR. There was also a bigger portion available for 15 EUR and it was really delicious. I can recommend you to stop by there as well. They are also selling burgers.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29128702595/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8538/29128702595_aef3c7050e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Pub Pelago Mossala halloumi salad pub pelago"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After lunch I continued cycling in Björkö. One ferry employee told me that the population is 80% Swedish and 20% Finnish speaking on these islands.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29095959106/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8348/29095959106_3e80b16f01_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie björkö cycling"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And again a maypole.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28509816533/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7528/28509816533_792a6a52d6_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Björkö Maypole Wicked Chilli Bike Mount"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From Kivimio I took the next ferry to Roslax.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29095942246/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8884/29095942246_e1488caba6_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Kivimo Roslax ferry"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And then the ferry from Houtskär to Korpo which was one of the longer ferry trips.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28841977990/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8346/28841977990_f3af1d2ae9_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Houtskär Korpo ferry"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After a few ferry trips I finally arrived in Nagu (or Nauvo).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29023233282/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8275/29023233282_1b82964e20_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Nauvo Church nagu"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Again there was a sailing ship attached to the ceiling of the church.

The Nagu (or Nauvo) church was built in the 1400-century.

My Surly Disc Trucker still made a good impression after 200 km cycling.

Nauvo is the biggest town on the islands. Nauvo has a nice harbour with plenty of restaurants.

There was also a Tourist Information at the harbour in Nouvo.

After having bought some snacks in the local grocery store I decided to continue my bicycle trip. Only 60 km left to Turku. Initially, I have planned another night in a tent but decided to cycle back home at the same day.

View from the Norrströmmenin bridge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28841929580/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8530/28841929580_50d43ec78b_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Norrströmmenin silta bridge"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unfortuantely, I did not spot any reindeers on my trip.

Again I had to take a ferry from Parainen to Nauvo.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/28841915400/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8285/28841915400_e9d22f3c39_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Ferry Prostvik Lillmälö"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Kirjalansalmen silta (bridge) was probably the most impressive bridge on this trail.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29095829416/in/dateposted-public/" title="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8068/29095829416_735c74ea53_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="The archipelago trail | Saariston Rengastie Kirjalansalmen silta"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Enjoyed a last view from the next bridge and then I arrived in Turku.

# Conclusion
I really enjoyed this bicycle trip but I would only recommend the part from Kustavi to Turku. The part between Turku and Kustavi is not that exciting except the city of Naantali (one of the highlights on this trip) and maybe the Askainen Knights Park and Louhisaari Manor (which I did not visit). Also I was cycling quite fast so you should probably add another day into your itinerary in case you are planning to cycle the Archipelago Trail as well. It might be also a good idea to spend a few days on the islands to explore them or to relax especially if the scenery is new for you.
