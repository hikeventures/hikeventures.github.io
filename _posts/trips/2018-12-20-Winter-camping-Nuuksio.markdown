Last weekend I went with Joni from [Leftbound](http://leftbound.com) to Nuuksio National Park in Finland to do some serious December winter camping.
Serious ... ? Well we had around -5C during the night so it was not that bad.

I especially, like those shorter trips. You can take much more gear with you and also fresh food which you could not take on longer trips. 

What I like in Nuuksio are those small hills and rocks and its easy accessible from Helsinki.

Joni became creative, taking underwater pictures with his iPhone.

But he also had his new Canon lens with him ... a 135mm f2 lens.

An old tree ...

Light snow was covering the ground.

And the lakes were frozen.

A HMG backpack and a pat to to stay warm when you sit somewhere.

A deep canyon.

And again ice and snow on a lake.

Joni experimenting a bit with his self made spoon.

And the water in the Nalgene bottle got frozen over night.

Boiling water in a 0.6l kettle which I got provided by Trangia. I think it's the perfect kettle for solo trips as it does not take much space and heats up water quite fast.

Our campfire. We spend quite some time chopping fire wood.

Enjoying the view towards the lake on the Chair Zero which we received from Helinox for testing. It's actually quite comfortable and packs quite small.

This was our Hilleberg Unna tent where we removed the inner tent so we could both fit in.
