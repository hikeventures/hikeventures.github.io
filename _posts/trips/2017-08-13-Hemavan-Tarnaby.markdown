Our packrafting adventure in the Hemavan Tärnby area started there where the Kungsleden ends or begins. We have planned in total 5 days of which we hiked 2 days and paddled 3 days. Some of the highlights during this trip were reindeers, a packraft which went down a waterfall and eagles circling in the sky.

More precisely we started our hike in the Vindelfjällens Naturreservat where archaeological over 8000 years olf artefacts have been found. It is one of Europe’s largest protected areas.

## Almost a packrafting desaster ...

When we came closer to the waterfall Caj was somewhat unfortunate and not able to paddle back to one side of the river. In able to rescue himself he had to let go his packraft and his backpack.

We found Caj's packraft just under the waterfall where it was circling around. Luckily we had Jeremie with us who is also a passionate climber and was able to get Caj's Packraft out.

Caj and Jeremie rescued Caj's backpack from the river which got stuck on a stone a few kilometers after Caj capsized and shortly before a bridge where Caj was able to cross the river again and get back to our side.

## Returning back to cizilization

In Tärnaby Camping we rented a cabin for 800 Swedish Kronar where we dried our gear and enjoyed a sauna.

The next day Jeremie had a new private record in packrafting.
