Today we had a short hike to the top of Komsa - which is the lookout point in Alta. There was no official path up to the Komsa, or at least we were not able to see it since everything was covered with snow.

From the city centre it takes about 1 hour to the top of the Komsa. The hill is easy to recognise since it has an antenna mast on top of it.

We were actually quite lucky with the weather. We started walking while it was snowing and the visibility was really bad.

However, once we got higher up, the sky cleared and we were able to have a breathtaking view over the scenery.

Unfortunately, after a view minutes we realised that a snowstorm would approach us from the sea in a couple of minutes and it became quite stormy.

We decided that it would be a good decision to walk down before the snowstorm hits us on the top of the Komsa.

So what did we see from the top of the Komsa?

## Airport
From the Komsa you can see the airport and how the planes are taking off and landing.

## Mountains
You can see all the mountains around Alta.

## City of Alta
Of course you are able to see the city of Alta itself.

## Fjord
The Alta Fjord which leads to the Arctic Sea.

Would we recommend climbing up the Komsa? Yes, definitely. If you happen to be in Alta this is probably one of the highlights you should visit.
