Today we had a short hike to the top of Komsa - which is the best lookout point in Alta and easy to reach. So it's probably one of the highlights when visiting Alta in Northern Norway and be on your "what to visit in Alta" list.

There was no official path up to the Komsa, or at least we were not able to see it since everything was covered with snow. We did not carry much with us. Just a backpack, our cameras, an additional layer of clothes and a Thermos bottle with tea.

From the city centre it's about a 1 hour hike to the top of the Komsa. The hill is easy to recognize since it has an antenna on top of it.

We were actually quite lucky with the weather. We started walking while it was snowing and the visibility was really bad.

However, once we got higher up, the sky cleared and we were able to have a breathtaking view over the scenery.

Once we reached the top we decided to to pull on another layer of insulating clothes. Hiking upwards to the top kept us however quite warm with less clothes.

Unfortunately, after a view minutes we realized that a snowstorm would approach us from the sea in a couple of minutes and it became quite stormy.

We decided that it would be a good decision to walk down before the snowstorm hits us on the top of the Komsa.

So what did we see from the top of the Komsa?

* Airport: From the Komsa you can see the airport and how the planes are taking off and landing.
* Mountains: You can see all the mountains around Alta.
* City of Alta: Of course you are also able to see the city of Alta.
* Fjord: The Alta Fjord which leads to the Arctic Sea.

Would we recommend climbing up the Komsa? Yes, definitely.

## Alternative trips
We have also been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hikeventures.com/winter-camping-alta/">winter camping and snowshoeing</a> in the neighborhood of Alta and we also went on a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hikeventures.com/hammerfest-daytrip/">day trip to Hammerfest</a>. Another highlight would be to climb up the Haldde - a nearby mountain which is about 1149m high with an Northern Lights observatory and a cabin on top of it. The hike should take about 2 hours during the snow free months. However, due to avalanche warning we decided to climb up the Haldde on our next visit to Alta.
