On our trip to Poland we went to South, visiting the Karkonosze National Park via Jelenia Góra. After doing some <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Packrafting-River-Bobr-Poland/">Packrafting</a> the day before we decided to go hiking.  Karkonosze Mountains are especially famous for it's legends and fairy tales. It is said that Rübezahl - a mountain spirit should live here. While Konstantin decided to hike to a castle in the mountains I went on a hike to the Polish-Czech border. My <a href="http://amzn.to/1MJFLxk">Suunto Ambit3</a> was quite useful to find the way up to the top as I had no clue where the 'official' trail was. Luckily, I found it half way up. <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-packrafting-poland-video/">Here</a> is also a short video.

Sometimes I came accross on these information boards partly sponsored by the European Union.

It was a bit difficult to find the right way up but following the coordinates on my watch the way up should be next to this this building.

One of the 'highlights' on this day was this stone formation on the way up.

During the summer time I prefer to wear <a href="http://amzn.to/1RSBgXZ">trail runners (Salomon Speedcross 3)</a> rather than hiking boots if I don't expect any swamps.

Parts of the trail were quite easy to hike. On some parts there were lots of falles trees on the trail since there was a heavy storm the night before.

<br>
And finally I found a bridge - the 'official' hiking trail - on the way up.

A signpost on the way up - Rozdroże Pod Śmielcem 1127 m

I enjoyed the view towards the valley with Jelenia Góra in the background.

Reaching the border w. signpost - Pod Smèlcem 1350 m - where you can also find a basic mountain hut.

Once I reached the top I saw one of the border stones which seperates Poland and the Czech Republic.

It was quite nice to hike along the border and I also met other hikers there. The trail on the main ridge is called 'Polish–Czech Friendship Trail' and crosses all summits. In the background you can see Śnieżne Kotły - one of the two glacial cirques - where you can also find the mountain peak Łabski Szczyt - which serves as a radio and TV tower - the source of the river Elbe. On my backpack you can see a <a href="http://amzn.to/1MpjibL">Thule Legend GoPro Case</a> which we got sponsored from Thule. More about this GoPro case soon on our blog...

Czech journalist Rudolf Kalman died here during a snow storm on 14 January 1929.

Due to the limited amount of time we spent in this part of Poland I was only able to do a day trip. Anyway, the next day I got muscle ache in my legs since I also went 10 km jogging up the mountain on the morning before the hike. Just not used to run in the mountains anymore as when I lived in Austria. Next time I would like to hike the complete trail if I plan to come here again. Here is the GPS data from <a hre="http://www.movescount.com/moves/move68498799">hiking</a> and <a href="http://www.movescount.com/moves/move68437371">jogging</a>.
