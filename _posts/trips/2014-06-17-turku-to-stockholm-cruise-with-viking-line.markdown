As I was planning to meet Konstantin in Sweden, I took a Viking Ferry in order to get from Turku to Stockholm. I really enjoyed this Viking Cruise with the new ferry, the [Viking Line][1].

The cruise starts at the Viking Terminal in Turku where I got my boarding card. While waiting for getting on board it's possible to get some drinks in the bar of the terminal.

It's a really nice experience to take a ferry from Finland to Sweden and experience the Aland Islands while having a nice dinner on board. There is also plenty of entertainment, a duty free shop and your kids will not get bored either.

The price of the cruise depends on the booking situation. The Viking Line tickets also get more expensive if you stay over night in Stockholm or Turku rather than taking the evening ferry back. It's also good to take a [wind jacket][2] or a [rain jacket][3] if you plan to stay for a longer period on deck.
