Today, I went on a day trip to Ruissalo. Ruissalo is the recreational island of Turku. It was involved in the Crimean war between the Swedish and Russians and nowadays it's a paradise for bird watchers, golfers and joggers. Since the island is quite big, I grabbed my bicycle and set off.

Golfing is possible in Ruissalo as well.
    
Ruissalo is a nice island very close to the city of Turku. There are also plenty of events throughout the year and it's also great for outdoors activities like going jogging along the shore of the island.
