Henrik from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">Deliverance Team</a> organised the first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the river Voxnan in Sweden and we decided to sign up on this event on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Facebook</a>. The swedish Packrafting Round-Up was also a great opportunity to meet <a href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpackaraft</a> - the manufacturer of our packrafts.
After a 4 hours drive from Stockholm we arrived at the starting point. We were 20 people from different countries and it was nice to see what kind of gear people had in their backpacks.

There was plenty of Hyperlite Mountain Gear around like the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid tarp. I probably need to get a new backpack by the end of the year as my Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter is slowly wearing off. Just not sure if it's going to be black or white ...

Welcome to the HikeVentures tent. We had our little flag with is. It was much easier to find our MSR Hubba Hubba tent again ... :)

That's how your trunk looks like when you go packrafting.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26673104960/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7726/26673104960_58a33ecd00_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - MSR Hubba Hubba NX"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On the first day Henrik welcomed everyone and gave a short briefing.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26342189713/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/26342189713_fedecd1f13_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - HMG Porter 4400 - MSR Hubba Hubba NX - Alpacka Raft - Werner Paddles, Petzl Meteor Helmet"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While the others were still pitching their tents Konstantin, Patrick and Caj went for a short rapid ride on the Voxnan. Even so the rapids don't look too dangerous it's always a good idea to wear a dry suite and a helmet (here the Petzl Meteor 3 helmet).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26878638661/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/26878638661_c090b4ef83_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Enjoying the the first evening around the camp fire. Konstantin is wearing his new Lundhags Jaure Light boots and Lundhags Merino Hoodie.

The next morning Konstantin prepared his breakfast sausage on our camp fire.

While <a href="http://urbanpackrafter.com/">Jacob</a> enjoyed fresh beacon.

We also prepared some porridge with our MSR WindBurner stove.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26579901894/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/26579901894_67426bc555_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - MSR WindBoiler Stove - Kupilka Cup"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After our breakfast we packed our gear and inflated our packrafts. Henrik gave another briefing about the trip and meeting points.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26914515216/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7632/26914515216_e6dc0a73f1_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Astral Designs V-Eight PFD - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Last gear checks before riding the rapid with our packrafts.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26879917251/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7542/26879917251_be4d366273_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft - GoPro Hero - Astral Designs V-Eight PFD"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Into the rapid. It took a while until everyone was with the packraft in the river Voxnan.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26914516236/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/26914516236_91b3c44d20_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Astral Designs V-Eight - Alpacka Raft - GoPro Hero"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Armada of Alpacka Rafts on the Voxnan. Which color do you like most? Green, Blue, Red or Banana Yellow?

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26359667893/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7747/26359667893_672395b16a_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016 - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While scouting the canyon we found remainings of a packrafter who tried to paddle through it. Was this a sign not to paddle through the canyon ...?

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26360809733/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7586/26360809733_8dcb469c01_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Skull in Lapland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The canyon was probably one of the spots most of us enjoyed most.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26931622726/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7377/26931622726_34a8e1a27a_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Astral Designs V-Eight - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Another exciting packrafter in the Canyon.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26965644515/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7103/26965644515_9c29933408_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

 Caj who just recently got his packraft did exceptionally well in the rapids.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26931973676/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/26931973676_57bc87ac92_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft - GoPro Session - Ray Ban"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Henrik from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a> was pretty good in shape as well.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26361239754/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/26361239754_a706ac859c_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So was Carl from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a>

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26362311913/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7376/26362311913_ebf790923b_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft - GoPro Hero camera"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and Michael ....

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26361239644/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7503/26361239644_5d54f541ea_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft - Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter 4400 - HMG - Astral Designs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

... and Torbjörn

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26361240524/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7651/26361240524_7443be447b_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Queuing was quite common especially before a rapid.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26377302274/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7529/26377302274_23fb45b134_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round Up - Alpacka Raft - Werner Shuna Paddles - Petzl Meteor Helmet - Julbo Race 2.0 - HMG Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter 4400 - Astral Designs V-Eight"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is hardly any rapid which can't be handled by the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a>

Where is the next rapid?

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26888501672/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7783/26888501672_5515ca4f22_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round Up - Astral Designs GreenJacket - Alpacka Raft - The Deliverance Team"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is Patrick from HikeVentures. You probably won't see him on many pictures since he is the guy who has to take them. Thanks to <a href="http://caide.kuvat.fi/">Caj</a> who took this picture. Patrick also enjoy his new Julbo Swell sunglasses. The glasses of the Julbo Swell can adapt to the light and they can also float on the water which comes quite handy when going packrafting.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26873718832/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7213/26873718832_c77a751c32_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Julbo Swell - Devold Expedition"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Do you know what this is? No, you won't use it to knit fancy dry suites. This rope can rescue life in certain situations.

Perfect view towards the Swedish landscape.

Some people prefer to stand when packrafting.

Packrafters are sometimes hard to spot in the rapid.

After the rapid is time to enjoy the nature and to relax.

 Some of us continued to Camp Vinströmmen - The wine rapid. Where Alpacka showed us some of their new products - Self-bailing packraft and the Apocalypse. After some test paddling on land they made it into the wine rapid as well. Konstantin Gridnevskiy full of excitement which boat to choose while Jakob trying some moves.

 Jeremie and Konstantin racing in the Vinströmmen. There was an Alapacka Ghost, Alpacka Scout, Alpacka Apocalypse and a self-bailing Alpacka Raft in the rapid.

Look at Konstantin's smile ... it almost seems like he is responsible for Jacob's situation in the Vinströmmen.

With the Alpacka Raft Ghost it was probably a bit more challenging to get through the Vinstömen rapid.

The Vinströmmen rapid was at some spots a bit more demanding.
