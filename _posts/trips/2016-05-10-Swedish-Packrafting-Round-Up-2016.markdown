Henrik from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">Deliverance Team</a> organised the first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the river Voxnan in Sweden and we decided to sign up on this event on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Facebook</a>. The swedish Packrafting Round-Up was also a great opportunity to meet <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpackaraft</a> - the manufacturer of our packrafts.
After a 4 hours drive from Stockholm we arrived at the starting point. We were 20 people from different countries and it was nice to see what kind of gear people had in their backpacks.

There was plenty of Hyperlite Mountain Gear around like the Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid tarp. I probably need to get a new backpack by the end of the year as my Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter is slowly wearing off. Just not sure if it's going to be black or white ...

Welcome to the HikeVentures tent. We had our little flag with is. It was much easier to find our MSR Hubba Hubba tent again ... :)

That's how your trunk looks like when you go packrafting.

On the first day Henrik welcomed everyone and gave a short briefing.

While the others were still pitching their tents Konstantin, Patrick and Caj went for a short rapid ride on the Voxnan. Even so the rapids don't look too dangerous it's always a good idea to wear a dry suite and a helmet (here the Petzl Meteor 3 helmet).

Enjoying the the first evening around the camp fire. Konstantin is wearing his new Lundhags Jaure Light boots and Lundhags Merino Hoodie.

The next morning Konstantin prepared his breakfast sausage on our camp fire.

We also prepared some porridge with our MSR WindBurner stove.

After our breakfast we packed our gear and inflated our packrafts. Henrik gave another briefing about the trip and meeting points.

Into the rapid. It took a while until everyone was with the packraft in the river Voxnan.

Armada of Alpacka Rafts on the Voxnan. Which color do you like most? Green, Blue, Red or Banana Yellow?

While scouting the canyon we found remainings of a packrafter who tried to paddle through it. Was this a sign not to paddle through the canyon ...?

The canyon was probably one of the spots most of us enjoyed most.

Another exciting packrafter in the Canyon.

 Caj who just recently got his packraft did exceptionally well in the rapids.

Henrik from the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a> was pretty good in shape as well.

Queuing was quite common especially before a rapid.

There is hardly any rapid which can't be handled by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a>

Where is the next rapid?

This is Patrick from HikeVentures. You probably won't see him on many pictures since he is the guy who has to take them. Thanks to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://caide.kuvat.fi/">Caj</a> who took this picture. Patrick also enjoy his new Julbo Swell sunglasses. The glasses of the Julbo Swell can adapt to the light and they can also float on the water which comes quite handy when going packrafting.

Do you know what this is? No, you won't use it to knit fancy dry suites. This rope can rescue life in certain situations.

Some people prefer to stand when packrafting.

Packrafters are sometimes hard to spot in the rapid.

After the rapid is time to enjoy the nature and to relax.

 In the Nordics there are a lot of pine trees. No need to take gas with you when you have a Boilerwerk Backcountry Boiler.

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpacka Raft</a> showed us how to fix a packraft.

 Konstantin seems to be quite happy in his banana boat while wearing his Julbo Race 2.0 sun glasses.

A PFD and a drysuite can help in certain situations.

While some of us had to pick up their cars from our starting location others were slowly packing their gear.

 Some of us continued to Camp Vinströmmen - The wine rapid. Where Alpacka showed us some of their new products - Self-bailing packraft and the Apocalypse. After some test paddling on land they made it into the wine rapid as well. Konstantin Gridnevskiy full of excitement which boat to choose while Jakob trying some moves.

Jeremie and Konstantin racing in the Vinströmmen. There was an Alapacka Ghost, Alpacka Scout, Alpacka Apocalypse and a self-bailing Alpacka Raft in the rapid.

Look at Konstantin's smile ... it almost seems like he is responsible for Jacob's situation in the Vinströmmen.

With the Alpacka Raft Ghost it was probably a bit more challenging to get through the Vinstömen rapid.

The Vinströmmen rapid was at some spots a bit more demanding.

And it was not possible for Jacob to get into his packraft again.

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://caide.kuvat.fi/">Caj</a> and Patrick spent the whole day in Stockholm, walking through the old town and watching the preparations for the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eurovision.tv/">SBS Eurovision song contest</a>. At 8 pm we left with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vikingline.com/">Viking Line</a> from Stockholm back home to Turku. Let's meet again next year for the Swedish Packrafting Round-Up organized by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a>. They did a really great job! We also want to thank <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> who provided a nice Dyneema Cuben Fiber bag for the Alpacka Repair Kit.‪
