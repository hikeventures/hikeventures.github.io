This Halloween, we decided to go to Lake Suolijärvi nearby Hyvinkää in Finland to do some Paddling and Hiking. [Janne][1] has sent me a [link][2] with the map beforehand, showing where shelters have been built in the Sveitsi - Kytäjän wilderness area.

## 1. Kytäjärvi to Iso-Haiskari
We started our trip from the car park next to lake Kytäjärvi, crossed it via the dam and followed the trail while passing by horse stables and farms. After a hike of 3 km we arrived in our first camp Iso-Haiskari.

For the night we have pitched a Tipi where three of us have spent the night in while our fourth paddling mate slept in the existing 'laava' shelter. I have also attached my <a href="http://bit.ly/ZNJUO3" target="_blank">LuminAid</a>  inflatable solar lantern on the tree on the picture below.

An inside view of the Tipi on the next morning. For my hiked I always stuff my items which are stuffed with down into a <a href="http://bit.ly/1tPzWaN" target="_blank">
compression bag</a> (the blue bag inside of the Tipi)

One of us started to inflate his canoe which he is going to use on the next day. It takes quite a while until the canoe has been inflated. So once this job has been done you can start enjoying your trip already.

Inside of our Tipi we had a foldable wood burning camp stove made entirely of Titanium (also the chimney which goes through the Tipi.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15689139455"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3940/15689139455_9390aed4e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Iso-Haiskari titanium stove finland scandinavia camping tent"></a>

Wood inside of the stove. With the small handle on the right top side of the stove you can regulate the stove. This stove really heads the Tipi. Unfortunately, the Tipi will cool down almost immediately once the stove gets cold.

On the next morning at 7.00. Bacon for breakfast.

Me, in the morning inflating my Packraft wearing a <a href="http://bit.ly/1wWSVjt" target="_blank">Mont Bell U.L. Down Jacket</a> and a <a href="http://bit.ly/1ztgxkb" target="_blank">Petzl Nao</a> headlamp.

Folding the chimney.

And that is the stove packed.

Some final checks before it gets into the lake.

My Teva Sandals are excellent in combination with my dry suite. They protect my rubber socks which I pull over my normal socks.

We paddled around the lake at Iso-Haiskari.

## 2. Iso-Haiskari to Kolmiperslammi
From Iso-Haiskari we carried our boats to Kolmiperslammi. Of course, it's much more easy to carry a 2.5 kg Packraft rather than a 21 kg canoe.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15689041615"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3937/15689041615_bf8451248d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="687" alt="Mobile Light Canoeing in Finland"></a>

Once we arrived at Kolmiperslammi, I noticed that the water on my packraft turned into ice.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15690650662" ><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3938/15690650662_ff271024b2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice on my packraft in Finland"></a>
At Kolmiperlammi we also enjoyed the sunrise from our boats and it also got warmer.

## 3. Kolmiperslammi to Vähä-Haiskari
From Kolmiperslammi we carried our boats to Vähä-Haiskari. Not only on trails but also through bushes.
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503654028"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3954/15503654028_088b31de0c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pulling / carrying a canoe through the forest in Finland - Iso-Haiskari to Vähä-Haiskari"></a>

## 4. Vähä-Haiskari to Haiskarinpoika
At Vähä-Haiskari we checked the location and then started paddling again.
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503845637" ><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5601/15503845637_ddf725dace_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alpacka Raft Yukon Yak at Vähä-Haiskari"></a>

My new Suunto [Ambit3][3] recorded the GPS data.

## 5. Haiskarinpoika to Mäkiperänlampi
Once we arrived in Haiskarinpoika, we noticed first thin ice layers on the lake.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15069090594"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7521/15069090594_053b270fc2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Waiting with a canoe paddle on a lake in Finland - Haiskarinpoika"></a>

Of course they were no obstacles for our boat yet.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503149759"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3949/15503149759_9c55fc4658_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Paddling with a canoe on a lake in Haiskarinpoika - Finland"></a>

But they had a beautiful structure.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15504377170"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3946/15504377170_b9808c73c7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="566" alt="Ice structures on lake in Finland - Haiskarinpoika"></a>

And then there was the warming sun again shining on some rocks where Janne just paddled by.

## 6. Mäkiperänlampi to Kiiskilampi
From Mäkiperänlampi to Kiiskilampi it became quite difficult to carry the canoe trough. However, they were far away from giving up.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503133439" ><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7511/15503133439_8d2c9b45fc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alpacka Raft Yukon Yak and Canoes in Finland - Mäkiperänlämpi - Kiiskilampi"></a>

But we reached Kiiskilampi where we had a short break.

## 7. Kiiskilampi to Suolijärvi
At Kiiskilampi, I climbed a rock from where I had a nice view over the lake. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15665403926" ><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3938/15665403926_cd66ed389a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="View towards the lake in Kiiskilampi"></a>

We paddled to the other side of the lake where we found a nice camp site where we prepared out lunch...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503127119" ><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5606/15503127119_c61aafa598_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camping and grilling a sausage in Kiiskilampi"></a>

...and took a picture of ourselves.

## 8. Suolijärvi to  Kytäjärvi
Once again we had to walk through dense bushes but then we finally arrived at lake Suolijärvi where I seperated myself from the others and paddled alone 4 km down the lake.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15689104005" ><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7559/15689104005_e0f6922090_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Paddling with Packraft and Canoe in Suolijärvi"></a>

Once I reached the dam at the end of lake Suolijärvi, I packed my packraft and walked the remaining 3 km back to the car park.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15688980665" ><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7531/15688980665_c87408f39c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="712" alt="Shelter in Suolijärvi"></a>

The short hike was quite nice as there was almost a full moon on the sky and the scenery was nice too (and easy to walk).

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503716818"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3943/15503716818_91297aa295_b.jpg" width="1024" height="604" alt="Kytäjärvi"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15503806467"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3956/15503806467_d082d8422a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="495" alt="Kytäjärvi"></a>

Lake Suolijärvi is a nice place for a hike. The are is not just plain flat and the shelters are very well maintained even so it's not an official national park.
