End of January we took a plane from Helsinki to Ivalo with Norwegian to do some snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in Finnish Lapland. Even so it was quite cloudy on our trip we were lucky as most of the tourists visiting Saariselkä are usually visiting Lapland between February and April.

So it was not that crowded. Nevertheless, we decided to stay with Suomen Latu in Kiilopää which is located at the entrance of the Urho Kekkonen National Park for three reasons - less tourists, more wilderness and only 20 km away from Saariselkä which we visited with the daily ski bus running between Kiilopää and Saariselkä.

In Helsinki we were waiting to get on board of the Norwegian flight to Ivalo.

The flight was pretty smooth. We had no turbulences. Here a view over Lapland shortly before landing in Ivalo.

At the Ivalo Airport you have to walk from the plane to the terminal in order to pick up your luggage. The airport is quite small but is decorated in a "Lapland style".

With the Eskelinen bus we went from Ivalo Airport to Kiilopää. We paid for the bus ticket 13 EUR.

Once we arrived the Fell Center Kiilopää we got our room key from the reception, carried our luggage to the room and changed our clothes in order to get ready for our first adventure. Night Snowshoeing!

The next day we woke up early and went cross-country skiing. We borrowed the whole equipment from the Fell Centre and they also properly waxed the skis beforehand.

The weather turned however bad and we had to ski in a snow storm.

Later on we also participated in a guided tour which was organised by the Fell Centre. The guide was French and lived in Finland for over 16 years.

In general we had a very great time in Saariselkä and Kiilopää. We can highly recommend the Fell Centre Kiilopää. The price value is really good, your are close to the wilderness, the food was good quality and staff was nice too. We will definitely come back here in the future.
