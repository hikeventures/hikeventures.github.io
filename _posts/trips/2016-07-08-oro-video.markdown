Last month we have visited the Fortress Island of Örö in the Finnish Archipelago. Once a military island, Örö is now a beautiful destination where you can enjoy a gorgeous view towards the baltic sea while learning about the history of the island on one if it's trails. [Here](http://www.hikeventures.com/Oro/) you can see more pictures and our trip report from Örö.
