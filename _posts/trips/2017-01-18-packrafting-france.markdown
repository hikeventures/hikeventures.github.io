Last year Konstantin has been on a four day packrafting course which was held by Servaes Timmerman. In total there have been 8 packrafts on and the rivers paddled were the Durance, Ubaye, Guil and the Allier. [Wandelen in de wereld](https://wandelenindewereld.wordpress.com/2016/08/28/de-lage-landen-packraftcursus/) has also posted about the packrafting course in France where you can see more pictures about this event.
