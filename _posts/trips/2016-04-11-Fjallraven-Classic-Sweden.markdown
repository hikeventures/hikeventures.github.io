Start of the race. This picture was taken last year at the very beginning of the Fjällräven Classic Race. I was the sixth one on the trail (including two runners) and I managed to keep this position virtually until the very end of the 110 km race. And unlike the people in front of me, I was carrying a way more.

Originally I was planning to hike the whole distance of 110 km in 4-5 days. But things do not always go as planned and instead I did it in under 54 hours.

I only realised how fast I was going only after we started to meet some people who started in the previous group several hours before us.

Hiking towards the top of Sweden. Even though the track is relatively easy, the views around you can be breathtaking.

Almost at Kebnekaise Mountain Lodge. While a busy event, I managed to enjoy the solitude most of the time. Only when I was approaching the checkpoints I could really see the whole extent of it.
