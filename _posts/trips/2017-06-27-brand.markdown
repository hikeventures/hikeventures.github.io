During my vacation in the Brandnertal I had the opportunity to travel with the Dorfbahn and the Panorama Bahn cable car from Brand (1005 m) up to the Burtschasattel (1680 m). Traveling with the Panorama Bahn cable car is quite exciting as you have the chance to look deep down into the valley.

Once at the Burtschasattel you can find the Restaurant Fröödö where you can get a meal or just a refreshment while enjoying the breathtaking view.

From the Burtschasattel walked along the Natursprünge-trail down to Parpfienz (1390 m).

The Natursprünge-trail is also quite interesting for kids who want to learn about the nature, ecology and geology of this region by reading the information boards which are located on the way.

On one information point I found antlers from a deer.

The meadows where also covered with flowers.

However, the best part of the Natursprünge-trail is the fantastic view over the Brandnertal and the surrounding mountains.

You will also meet cows and a small restaurant at Parpfienz (1390 m) which sells local products and snacks. However, don't expect big meals but fresh cheese.

The Natursprünge-trail is also suitable for families with small children carrying a buggy with them as the trail is well maintained.

Probably a good idea is to start the hike from the summit of the Panorama cable car and hike the trail down. It takes about 1 hour to the Dorfbahn depending how much time you spend reading the information boards.

From the Alp Parpfienz it's only a short walk back to the Dorfbahn cable car. From here you can decide to walk down (takes about 1 hour) to Brand or travel down with the cable car.

View from the Dorfbahn cable car towards Brand and the Lünersee.

Once back in Brand I enjoyed a fresh salad at the Restaurant Romantik Hus which offers reasonable priced meals.

## Parpfienz, Barfussweg and cows

Between Parpfienz and the Dorfbahn cable car summit you can also find the Barfussweg where you have the opportunity to walk without your hiking boots. The cows you meet on the trail are friendly and you can get very close to them. Just don't try to disturb them when they have newborns.

## Mountain Running
If you are into mountain running you can run up the whole trail from Brand up to the Dorbahn cable car summit as I did. It's a bit challenging but once you reach the summit you can take the cable cars back to the valley.

The distance from the Burtschasattel down to the Panorama Bahn summit is about 4 km and from Brand about 10 km. You can use regular running shoes to run the trail up to the summit. The trail starts in Brand just behind the Dorfbahn cable car.

## Costs
What's more you can also rent a hand cart which costs about 15 EUR. The family day ticket for both cable cars costs around 34 EUR.

## Conclusion
Would I visit Brand again? Sure! Brand has to offer a lot. It's a small village but you can even find a golf course there and if you visit Brand with your family you can also rent a more affordable apartment. What's more, if you stay over night in one of the hotels or apartments then you can ask at the reception if they can hand you out their local guest card (free of charge) which you can use for transportation between Lünersee and Bürs with the local public bus.
