Today, I went with the bicycle from Vaasa to Bjököby where I planned to visit the Kvarken Archipelago - an UNESCO World Heritage site. The distance to the Swedish mainland is just about 80 km and the depth of the water is max. about 25 meters. The area has been populated by human beings since 7000 years.

There is something special on this area: The land is rising at about 1 cm a year (as there was a Glacier 10.000 - 24.000 years ago).

And bicycled on the longest bridge of Finland (1.045 metres long).

Unfortunately, there is no good bus connection from Vaasa to Bj&#246;rk&#246;by, so I had to come by bicycle as I do not have a car. The distance to Bj&#246;rk&#246;by is about 40 km from Vaasa. During the summer months, there is one bus going on Saturdays only but you have to make a reservation.

It took me about 2 hours from Vaasa to Björköby by bicycle. I passed the longest bridge in Finland, small villages and cycled next to the sea. There are also plenty of hiking possibilities e.g. the nature trail Bodvattnet runt which passes Bodback - an old harbour - but some require to a <a href="http://www.kvarkenworldheritage.fi/experience-kvarken/boat-transport/" target="_blank">arrange a boat</a> beforehand. There are also boat museum and an annual sailing race event called <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postrodden" target="_blank">Postrodden</a>.

Once I arrived there I climbed up the Saltkaret observation tower and enjoyed the scenic view.

The local community should maybe think of better transportation possibilities and arrangements for hikers which I found personally very poor for a World Heritage site. However, I can recommend the <a href="http://www.pohjanmaanmuseo.fi/?page=TERRANOVA&setlang=l3" target="_blank">Terranova museum</a> in Vaasa which describes quite well the Kvarken Archipelago.
