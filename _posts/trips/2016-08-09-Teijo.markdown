Last weekend I visited the Teijo National Park located about 1.15 hours South-East of Turku to go hiking. Teijo National Park has a lot of variety like lakes, marshes, forests, marshes and a sea bay. The marked trails are easy to hike. Teijo National Park is suitable for those who don't have much hiking experience.

I parked my car nearby the nature center at Matildanjärvi. The nature center offers plenty of information about the national park and you can also get a free copy of a map.

The borders of the National Park are marked with this sign.

There was also an information board nearby the nature center where I parked my car.

I hiked along the trail along Matildanjärvi. On the trail are several fire places and lean-to shelters. I passed by at Kavanderinlahti - where a group of girls had prepared their camp for the night - and Roosinniemi before leaving Matildanjärvi.

While hiking I dicided to add Puolakkajärvi to my trip as well - the next nearby located lake to Matildanjärvi.

Puolakkajärvi is partly located outside of the Teijo National Park which is ok to hike but nothing special until you reach the Endal lean-to shelter.

From Endal I continued walking to Teerisaari, Vicksbäckinlahti and then back to Matildanjärvi where Isoholma was the last lean-to shelter on the way back to my starting point.

The trail outside of the National Park nearby Puolakkajärvi was not that spectacular.

Trucks were collecting sand from this place.

Once back in the National Park the scenery changed again.

Teijo National Park is a great place to escape to the nature, it's close to Turku and offers plenty of facilities. I will probably come back here in a few months during the winter to try out some winter camping.
