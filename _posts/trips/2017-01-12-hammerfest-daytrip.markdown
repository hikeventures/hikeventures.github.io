This morning we went to the tourist office in Alta to buy our tickets for the bus to Hammerfest and also for the way back to Alta with the speed ferry through the Alta Fjord.

## From Alta to Hammerfest by bus
We started our trip at 9am in Alta and the bus took us along the Fjord into the uplands where the winter sun tried to reach the horisont. However, it would still take the sun another week until it would be visible again.

At 10.30 we arrived Skaidikroa where we had a glass of milk and waited for the next bus which were about to leave at 11.45 towards Hammerfest.

The road along the coast was impressive. Rocks, snow and water. Here and there were a few houses. And there was also a big bridge which we had to cross with the bus. Again the view on both side of the bridge was impressive.

## Arriving in Hammerfest
We arrived in Hammerfest at around 12.45. Once we arrived at the bus terminal in Hammerfest we walked to the local tourist office where we had a conversation with the staff. Two immigrants - one from Germany and the other one from Finland who lived here already since a couple of years.

## Royal and Ancient Polar Bear Society
In the Tourist Office we decided to become members at the Royal and Ancient Polar Bear Society which was founded in 1963 in Hammerfest we walked to the local church which was built in the 1960s.

## Museum of Reconstruction
Then we visited the Museum of Reconstruction which was about to close when we entered the museuem. However, the friendly person at the ticket desk told us that we can quickly browse through the museum as were only a few hours in Hammerfest.

The exhibition itself was quite good and one could quite imagine the hard times 40.000 people had who got deported by 1945 in Northern Norway. There were also pictures about the city which got burned down by the Germans at the end of the Second World War.

## Lookout Point
After our visit in the museum we decided to walk up to a lookout point where we enjoyed again a fantastic view over the city and the sea. The whole city was glowing with it's hundreds of lights in the darkness - even so it was only 3pm.

Then it was time to get back to the city where we walked along the harbor. Konstantin spotted a fish store where Konstantin tried a local delicatese.

The nearby Coop (grocery store) was also a good opportunity for us to fill our backpacks with some snacks. We bought a local leaf of bread (the bread in Norway tastes actually quite good), cheese, tomatoes and cucumber. Konstantin also bought grilled chicken and then we were good to go.

## The express boat from Hammerfest to Alta
At 4.40pm we were ready to get on board of our boat. A few other people were waiting there as well. There was also a Sami couple which we were able to identify through their traditional Sami clothes.

Once we entered the boat, we enjoyed the food which we just bought and enjoyed the 2 hours on the boat - Konstantin preparing a presentation for the University in Alta and Patrick writing an article for the blog.

## Conclusion
If you are planning to visit Northern Norway you should definitely visit Hammerfest. It's an interesting and also beautiful city with 10.000 inhabitants and a great scenery.

Probably you should also plan a few days hiking in the area as well. If you are not into camping then you could also stay in one of the hotels (Scandic or Thon) which you can also find in Alta.

In general, it was a great trip and worth the money spent on traveling.
