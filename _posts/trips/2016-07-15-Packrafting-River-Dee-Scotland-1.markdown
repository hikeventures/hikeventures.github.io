In January we made plans to go packrafting in the Scottish Highlands and decided to raft down the River Dee for a couple of days. Knowing that the temperatures were below 0 C degree during the night we were quite lucky with the weather as we had sunshine until the last day. For Konstantin the River Dee was the the second of the three great rivers of Scotland. Maybe Next year he will have a chance to do the third?

## Meeting at the airport
We met at the airport in Edinburgh - Konstantin arrived just 1 hour later than Patrick - and we took the new tram from the airport to the city center. Once we arrived in the city center we were searching for Konstantin's hotel where he was planning to stay for another week after our planned packrafting trip. We unloaded some of our clothes from our backpack in the hotel and started walking through the city towards the central station.

## With the train from Edinburgh to Aberdeen
At 16.28 we left Edinburgh with the Scotrail train to Aberdeen. The train was packed and the train conductor apologiesed several times for this on the loudspeaker. Fortunately, we had both made a seat reservation. A woman behind us booked a forward seat but got a small one on which she had to travel sideways. She swapped it with another person, who was not able to find her reserved seat and was happy with the one she got.

## The Scottish Scenery
The scenery outdoor is great. We went over the bridge which just got listed by the unesco, and passed by to the other side of the Forth. People steped off and on the train, but the further we went, the few people there were. We passed by places with difficult English names and in completely unpronounceable Scottish. Finally, we went over an impressive railway bridge in Dundee (is it the same name as in Australia, Patrick asked) and then we finally arrived in Aberdeen after dark.

## With the bus to Braemar
The next morning we packed our backpacks and had a typical English breakfast in our hotel before we went to the bus station to catch the train to Braemar.

## Arrival in Braemar
We were more than lucky with the weather. It was cold, but windless and very sunny. When we arrived, we tried to step out where everyone did but the bus driver asked us if we wanted to get out a bit further. How far? Just over that building. No thank you, we rather walk and explore the village. Patrick went to the local grocery store to buy bottled water and a toothbrush and then went had a look in the outdoor shop that we saw on the way as he needed another [pair of socks](https://www.rei.com/product/887221/darn-tough-hiker-boot-socks-mens) to wear them under the drysuite to keep the feet warm in the freezing water. Patrick asked for Icebreaker socks but the sales person adviced him to try [Darn Tourgh Hiker socks](https://www.rei.com/product/887221/darn-tough-hiker-boot-socks-mens) as they were more durable according to him. But were they? well time will tell.

## Enjoying a cup of tea in Braemar
Konstantin was left with the luggage in the sun while Patrick did his shopping. The sun was just marvellous. Konstantin felt that it's golden rays were  poring over him warming his whole body to the core. At the same time there were patches of snow lying around and the air gave that crispy smell that only winter has.

On the opposite side from the bus stop Konstantin discovered a tea room and decided to move our things there. A middle aged man was sweeping the street next to it. So Patrick ran for his socks while Konstantin carried our bags to the hall and entered the place.
The place looked cosy. There were not a lot of people there, just a couple that travelled with us from Aberdeen on the same bus. They didn't have a lot of luggage with them, but it seemed that they came to Breamar for a romantic getaway.

When Konstantin entered, he was approached by a middle aged woman wearing a neat white apron, who asked him where he would like to sit. Konstantin chose the corner table with a bit of a view and the sun coming through the window. The other sunny spot was already occupied by the couple. When Konstantin sit down, the woman brought him the menu, which he didn't really need as he knew exactly what he wanted - a pot of tea.

Talking about the concept of the pot of tea - Konstantin hardly ever saw anything like that on a menu anywhere else outside Britain. And as a tea drinker, he thought that it's a shame that people don't do it more often as the British got it right - one small cup of tea, the one that you usually get in the Netherlands or in other parts on the continental Europe, just won't do it. You cannot just have one. You need more. And a pot of tea is a perfect solution for it.

Having ordered his pot of tea, Konstantin had a chance to look around. Besides the woman who severed him, there was another elderly woman, wearing a similar neat white apron. She was busy doing something behind a glass display which contained a five selection of most deliciously looking muffins and pastry. Looking at them he wished that he would still eat sugar. But Konstantin had to stay strong and chased the tempting thoughts away. His pot of tea arrived and standing.

## On the way to the River Dee
Refreshed we started walking to find a place where we could inflate our packrafts and to finally start with our packrafting trip. It has been very cold during the night and the gras was still frozen. However, the wonderful scenery and sun made us feel excited to start paddling and to get close to the nature.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25607400980/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/25607400980_4a2ed0c9df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After a short hike we found a spot which was suiteable to inflate our packrafts and to easily get into the river. On some spots the river was partly frozen but as we realized later on it was not difficult to break with our packrafts through the ice.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25813026991/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1540/25813026991_f2dc51fe86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Inflating the Packrafts
Having inflated our packrafts we were good to go. Konstantin inflated his packraft on a different spot but Patrick was the first one who made it into the river.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25720737682/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1499/25720737682_7e90c9e959_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The mountains were still covered with snow. We actually had a discussion if we should go on a hiking trip before packrafting down the river Dee but decided to start paddling immediately as the weather forecast only promised good weather for the coming 2 days.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25815608426/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1507/25815608426_e63297c5c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Already at the beginning we realized that the water level of the Dee was quite low. Nevertheless, it was still possible to paddle but we had to step out occassionally and walk in the cold river. That's the part where Patrick's additional [socks](https://www.rei.com/product/887221/darn-tough-hiker-boot-socks-mens) became an important part of gear.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25211155704/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1543/25211155704_7246941e5b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

An advantage of a river with a low water level is that there are plenty of opportunities to get our of the packraft to have a break. We had our first brake already after 30 minutes or so.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540976580/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1678/25540976580_95957933d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Sometimes ice can create an interesting motive for pictures.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25607397050/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/25607397050_0013dbdd99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Deer fencing
After some paddling we came across the first obstacle which we have read about already in several other blogs and websites -  the deer fence. However, the fence was in such a bad shape that it was quite easy to paddle under the steel rope on the left side of the river.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25720731532/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1702/25720731532_b15b7974c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After the fence it was quite easy to paddle along the river and there were no major obstacles or rapids until we reached the first major rapid at the Invercauld bridge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25746562021/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1670/25746562021_69799f21d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## The Invercauld bridge
The invercauld bridge was built in 1859 and we were looking for a spot where we could step out of our packrafts so that we could go and scout the rapid which flows just under the bridge. Again the low water level didn't offer many opportunities to pass our first major obstacle as we realized on our scout.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25841666865/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1624/25841666865_141d7f355a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Our first scout put Konstantins new <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Sea-to-Summit-Ultra-Flex-Booties/">Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booties</a> into test.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25215076843/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1525/25215076843_72b6fa4c0b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Invercauld bridges were actually quite interesting and built in Victorian architecture style.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540972010/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1596/25540972010_8f7df53c2d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We were walking along a small path next to the river to find out if it was possible to paddle the rapid.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540971350/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1514/25540971350_3513fb43df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Not only the River Dee makes it interesting to paddle there ...

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540970700/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1687/25540970700_3df0722898_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

... but also the rich historical culture and buildings on the way.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25746558441/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1481/25746558441_7f3751e22b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We went on and under the Invercauld bridge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25211168844/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1577/25211168844_97c62028f0_o.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I guess this picture shows already that it was still quite cold to paddle.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25841663315/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1653/25841663315_8d3a19524b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As you can see on the picture the water level was quite low and it was hard to find the right spot to pass this rapid. There were many stones where you could get stuck with your packraft and flip over. Patrick decided to carry the packpack around and to take pictures of Konstantin paddling through the rapid.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25215076133/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1595/25215076133_a6ef1fd5c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Konstantin on a small rapid after the main rapid under the Invercauld bridge.

Looking backwards from our packrafts the Invercauld bridge was quite an experience.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25815614586/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/25815614586_cfb6efc395_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Cambus O' May suspension bridge
The suspension bridge at Cambus O' May was built in 1905 and rebuilt in 1988 for safety reasons and one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Victorian sites in this area.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25211142164/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1646/25211142164_58e03539d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Cambus O' May bridge got quite heavily damaged during the floods 3 months ago.

## Problems with the Packraft
Konstantin's had some issues with his Alpacka Packraft during our trip. Air went out through the zippers and there was a puncture at the bottom of his packraft which he managed to temporarily quick fix it.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25607416640/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1576/25607416640_4cca5435b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After our trip Konstantin contacted Alpacka Raft and reported the issue on his packraft. Alpacka agreed to fix both issues on his packraft and also paid for the shipping fees. We would say that this is quite good customer service from Alpacka Raft.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25841679395/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1582/25841679395_279021f44d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Camping nearby Balmoral Castle
When the sun started to set we decided to look for a place where we could step out of our packrafts and to pitch our tent. It was already quite cold and we were already quite tired after this day. After we pitched our [MSR Hubba Hubba Tent](https://www.rei.com/product/863076/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-tent) we prepared our dinner. Patrick enjoyed one of the meals which Konstantin brought from Japan while Konstantin prepared a Real Tumac dinner with our [MSR Windburner](https://www.rei.com/product/890802/msr-windburner-stove-system).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25720721372/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1543/25720721372_88b2387369_b.jpg" width="1024" height="743" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then it was time to crawl into our sleeping bags where we reviewed the day and our experiences and slowly fell aslpeep under the stars while listening to the flow of the river dee.
