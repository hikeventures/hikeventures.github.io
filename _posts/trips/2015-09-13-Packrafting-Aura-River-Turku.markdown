Two weeks ago I took my packraft to explore the city center of Turku by paddling down the Aura River. You can get a quite different view from the city when you see it from your boat. I came accross plenty of river boats which are converted into restaurants, bridges, the Turku Cathedral, etc. The whole paddling trip took me approximately 40 minutes in one direction. Next time I will paddle the river with a Kayak...it's going to be slightly faster :)
