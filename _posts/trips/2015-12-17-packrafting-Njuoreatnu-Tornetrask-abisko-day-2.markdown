We fell asleep almost instantly the night before in our tent which we pitched on an island in the lake Inngajávri after having [packrafted][1] till late in the night. Patrick only had a few issues with his sleeping pad - the Therm-a-Rest Evolite which is a self-inflating sleeping pad for the summer - which was probably not that suitable for lower night temperatures here in the North. Patrick had to wear an additional Merino base layer and added another layer of thermo foil on top of his sleeping pad to get a proper insulation. Konstantin however had a proper night sleep on his Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Xtherm.

And that's how the tent wall looks like when you go camping in Scandinavia - hungry mosquitoes waiting for their breakfast.

Once we got out of the tent we enjoyed the breathtaking view towards the Swedish mountains which were still covered with snow.

After we packed our backpacks and enjoyed our breakfast we continued our paddling trip along the Inngajárvi lake.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23370868060/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5698/23370868060_d817fd836b_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Suunto Ambit3 and GoPro  - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - HMG Porter 4400 - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Sometimes Patrick also checked the altitude and the distance on his [Suunto Ambit3][2] and took a few pictures with the assistance of the GoPro [remote control][3].

Then it was time to switch from lake Inngajárvi to the lake Vuolip Njuorajávri which are connected by a rapid.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640463656/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/568/23640463656_1ee94203d8_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Alpacka Raft - HMG Porter 4400 - Werner Shuna"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As we were not able to see from our packrafts how the rapid looked ahead of us we decided to 'park' our packrafts on the shore of the lake and to walk along the rapid to evaluate if we would be able to packraft through it.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23557993512/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/667/23557993512_558fd7c5ec_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Anfibio Packsuit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unfortuntely, there were some rocks in the rapid which would not allow us to get smoothly through the rapid. So we decided to walk with our packrafts around it and set our packrafts back into the water once we reached lake Vuolip Njuorajávri.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640455806/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5733/23640455806_0cc7b634b6_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Anfibio Packstuit - Petzl Meteor - HMG Porter 4400"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, since we didn't go through the rapid we decided to playboat a bit at the end of the rapid.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23584075731/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5674/23584075731_288f982c81_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - HMG Porter 4400 - Alpacka Packraft - Nalgene Bottle"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There were a couple of bridges on our way. Some looked a bit old and it felt a bit scary to walk on them.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23039465743/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/623/23039465743_bb65172746_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Anfibio Packsuit - Suunto Ambit3"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Around lunch time we decided to stop on a nice sandy shore and to prepare some lunch. Patrick is not such a fan of those ready made dehydrated lunch packages which can be bought in many camping stores. Luckily Konstantin still had some bread in his backpack which he bought before our trip.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23038362284/in/dateposted-public/" title="MSR Windboiler - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5739/23038362284_ea73194da7_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Camping stove at Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - MSR WindBoiler - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After having had a proper lunch we enjoyed a warm cup of tea. Tea always helps us to regenerate when we feel cold or exhausted.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23039447243/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kupilka Fjällräven - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/703/23039447243_a11b1e8fca_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Kupilka - Fjällräven Hat Cap"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then it was time to scout again. There was another bridge which made a more solid impression to us.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23039442713/in/dateposted-public/" title="Petzl Packrafting Meteor3 bridge - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5750/23039442713_e42d5aa176_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Anfibio Packsuit - Petzl Meteor Helmet - Suunto Ambit3 - HMG Porter 4400"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The rapid looked like lots of fun and we decided to paddle it and also made sure to wear our [helmets][4] to be on the safe side.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23557961942/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/603/23557961942_30ec8df117_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - River - Rapid"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After some paddling we decided to have a break again.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640422566/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/704/23640422566_ec9f2047ee_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Alpacka Raft - Yukon Yak Denali Llama - Werner Shuna Paddles"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The rapid became a bit unpredictable and at some spots quite dangerous to paddle. So we decided to start hiking and scout for a new spot where it would be suitable to get back into the river.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640419666/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5624/23640419666_5ef5e2f79c_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - HMG Porter 4400"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After walking for a while we figured out that it still might take a while until we could start packrafting again so we packed our packrafts and attached them on our backpacks. At this moment we realised that hiking boots would have been a better solutions rather than walking with our sandals. We had to climb up steep hills and it was rather slippery. And then there were also those hungry mosquitoes ...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23584041531/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5724/23584041531_b8cacd53d2_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Wearing a Petzl Meteor3 helmet and Werner Paddles  while Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - PEtzl Meteor helmet - Alpacka Raft - HMG Porter 4400 - Werner Shuna Paddles"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Finally, we found a spot where we were able to packraft again.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23557946362/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/685/23557946362_90c4a0b150_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Rapid"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, after a while we had to pack our packrafts again and start walking through dense shrubbs and climbing hills.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23666492795/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/746/23666492795_f6da8981f7_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Valley - Canyon - Alpacka Raft - Visitsweden"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One of the reasons why it is sometimes better to walk rather than to packraft. Sometimes you get even awarded with a nice view.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640406716/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/735/23640406716_994b72c0c3_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Rapid - Canyon"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After walking for a while we were able to see the last bridge on this river. At this spot the Njuoreatnu river became more calm as it flows into the Torneträsk lake.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640403316/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5647/23640403316_8fabf1f001_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Alpacka Raft"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From the bridge we had a nice view towards the Torneträsk lake (the second deepest and the sixth largest lake in Sweden).

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/23640400566/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5665/23640400566_951781e997_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting Njuoreatnu - Torneträsk - Abisko Sweden - Suspension Bridge"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was slowly getting dark but we continued paddling until we reached another island where we pitched our tent. We felt quite cold and exhausted after this day. We just prepared a quick dinner and then we called it a day.
