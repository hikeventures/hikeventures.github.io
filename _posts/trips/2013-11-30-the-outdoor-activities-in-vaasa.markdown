Vaasa is a small town with a population of 67.000 souls on the west coast of Finland. The area is more or less flat with the exception of &#214;jberget, which is located about 5 km outside of Vaasa where you can go downhill and cross-country skiing.

If you are interested in climbing, then you can give it a try in the <a href="http://www.highsport.fi" target="_blank">water tower</a> of Vaasa - straight in the city centre next to the tourist office.

For those who like hiking trips, a ride to Bj&#246;rkeby or &#214;jen (40km north of Vaasa) might be an option to enjoy the Kvarken Archipelago - an UNESCO world heritage site. kvarkenworldheritage.fi is a good website to find more information about the Kvarken Archipelago. Unfortunately, public transportation is quite bad in the Vaasa region so having a car or taking a taxi is more or less the only way to get there (or with a bicycle if you are still in the mood to hike once you arrive there).

If you come with a group, you should check Reino Tupa. They have a great kitchen, Sauna and possibilities to do quad biking.

Other options which around Vaasa are to visit bird towers or Kajane - a swampy area south of Vaasa.

If you are more into packrafting, the Bothnian Sea or Pilvil&#228;mpi are great spots to inflate your boat.

To learn more about the area and in particular the Kvarken Archipelago, a visit to <a href="http://terranova.vaasa.fi" target="_blank">Terra Nova</a> - a museum in the city of Vaasa is highly recommended. Entrance is free of charge on Fridays.

Hiking and fishing gear is sold by <a href="http://www.kurre.fi" target="_blank">Kurre</a>, Intersport and <a href="http://www.wasasport.fi" target="_blank">Wasasport</a> in Vaasa.
