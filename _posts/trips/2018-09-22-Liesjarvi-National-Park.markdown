A few days ago I visited the <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/liesjarvinp/">Liesjärvi National Park</a> together with Kaj and Catja Koskinen to try our our new Alpacka Raft Gnarwhal which we bought at Packraft Europe who also organised the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Slovenia/">European Meet-up</a> in Slovenia. Liesjärvi National Park is about a 1.5 hours car drive away from Helsinki and an alternative to Nuuksio National Park if you live in the Helsinki region (and probably also less crowded with people) and want to go hiking or packrafting.

We decided to park our cars at the Kopinlahti parking spot and to have a short hike to Savilahti where we pitched our tents, prepared a fire and meals and enjoyed the peaceful night together with a few other hikers who also came to stay over night in tents and hammocks.

Even so it was raining when I arrived at the parking spot it turned out that the evening was dry with just a few clouds on the sky. This was a great opportunity to test the astrophotography capabilities of my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2I5aRnS" >Sony A7III</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2I77QmZ" >Zeiss Batis 25mm</a>.

At the camp fire we grilled sausages and talked about the past and upcoming trips.

Also I became interested to create my own dehydrated camping food in the future because I am really fed up of eating the stuff which you can buy in the camping store. I already bought a dehydrator and I am planning to experiment a bit with it during the winter season.

This picture was taken by looking upwards from the campfire. I think it's a really nice effect - the bright trees and the sparkling stars in the sky.

The next morning I checked out Katja's new HMG Porter 5400 (white) next to my HMG Porter 4400 (black). Probably I will also get the bigger pack next year as the Porter 4400 is just getting too small for longer trips.

Then we took a view videos on how we inflated the packrafts and then it was time for packrafting.

The day was a bit mixed and we had quite strong showers at the beginning.

Later on we prepared lunch back in camp and then returned to our cars. I supposed this can be called a microadventure - I really like those.
