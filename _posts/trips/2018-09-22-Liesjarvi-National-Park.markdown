A few days ago I visited the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/liesjarvinp/">Liesjärvi National Park</a> together with Kaj and Catja Koskinen to try our our new Alpacka Raft Gnarwhal which we bought at Packraft Europe who also organised the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Slovenia/">European Meet-up</a> in Slovenia.

We decided to park our cars at the Kopinlahti parking spot and to have a short hike to Savilahti where we pitched our tents, prepared a fire and meals and enjoyed the peaceful night together with a few other hikers who also came to stay over night in tents and hammocks.

Even so it was raining when I arrived at the parking spot it turned out that the evening was dry with just a few clouds on the sky. This was a great opportunity to test the astrophotography capabilities of my <a href="https://amzn.to/2I5aRnS" rel="nofollow">Sony A7III</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2I77QmZ" rel="nofollow">Zeiss Batis 25mm</a>.

At the camp fire we tried to take some pictures and it worked quite well.

Also I became interested to create my own dehydrated camping food in the future because I am really fed up of eating the stuff which you can buy in the camping store. I already bought a dehydrator and I am planning to experiment a bit with it during the winter season.

This picture was taken by looking upwards from the campfire. I think it's a really nice effect - the bright trees and the sparkling stars in the sky.

The next morning I checked out Katjas new HMG Porter 5400 (white) next to my HMG Porter 4400 (black). Probably I will also get the bigger pack next year as the Porter 4400 is just getting too small for longer trips.

Then we took a view videos on how we inflated the packrafts and then it was time for packrafting.

The day was a bit mixed and we had quite strong showers at the beginning.

Later on we prepared lunch back in camp and then returned to our cars. I supposed this can be called a microadventure - I really like those.
