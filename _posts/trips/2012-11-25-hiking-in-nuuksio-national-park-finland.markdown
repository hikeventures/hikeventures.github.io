The Nuuksio National Park is located close to Helsinki (1 hour bus trip - 85A from Espoo Centre) and a popular place for people living in Helsinki to get away from the busy city life and enjoy the outdoors and go hiking, camping, packrafing or kayaking. You will find gorges formed by the last ice age, valleys, 43 lakes and hills which are up to 110 meters.

## Hiking
I went to Nuuksio several times hiking. Once, it was end of December and we had +5 Â°C in Southern Finland which is quite unusual for this time of the year. However, this was a good opportunity to test my new <a href="http://hikeventures.com/arcteryx-tecto-fl-jacket/" target="_self">jacket</a>, visit the new <a href="http://www.haltia.com" target="_blank">Finnish Nature Center Haltia</a> and to have a short hike from Haltia to Haukkalampi and back (10 km).

Haukkalampi is the most common starting point for a hike in Nuuksio. During the warmer months it can be quite crowded here as hiking is quite popular in Finland.

Finnish Nature Center Haltia has been opened recently where you can explore different aspects of the nature in Finland.

There are plenty of sign boards on the main trails and plenty of trails leaving from the Nature Center Haltia into the woods.

This sign can be found in every National Park in Finland. It shows that you are now entering the National Park.

Well maintained trails over swamps.

I saw an abandoned cottage in the middle of the forest. Who might have lived here before?

Some trails are very easy to hike since they are so well maintained. Comfortable stairs leading up the hill.

Mosses covering stones. It was quite wet on this day but there were also less people strolling around in the park.

Haukkalampi - our destination. Most of the visitors start their hike in Nuuksio from here.

Toilets - For those who prefer the more civilised way.

An opportunity to refill your water bottle with fresh water.

Since the Nuuksio National Park is located nearby Helsinki it is probably the easiest accessible National Park in Finland for most of the people and there are several buses operating from Helsinki and Espoo.

During the weekends the park is sometimes quite crowded especially around the fire places but you can also hike off the main tracks.
