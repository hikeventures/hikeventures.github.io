About three weeks ago, Konstantin joined the other 20 packrafters for a Packrafting Weekend organized by <a href="http://hikingadvisor.be">hikingadvisor.be</a> in the south of Belgium on the Semois where we met in the morning of the 11th of April.<br><br>

Not everyone among the participants of the Packrafting Weekend were experienced packrafters. For most of them it was actually their very first time and they had to learn a lot even before they got into their packrafts.<br>

Recently a number of other companies released their own versions of packrafts, which, surprisingly, look very much alike the alpackarafts. Coincidence?<br><br>

A short excursion stop during Packrafting Weekend 2015 in the south of Belgium. As the paddling distance was not that long and we had a lot time, we had a longer stop. During it all who wanted could go and climb the top of the hill.<br><br>

To take this shot and the one before I waded waist-high into the water. - Was not it too cold? - you may ask. - Not really, as I was wearing my drysuit<br><br>

Away from the river, up to the mountain top | Having left our packrafts at the water, about half of the participants of Packrafting Weekend took a short 2 km walk to the top of the hill/mountain overlooking the Semois valley.<br><br>

The organizers rented this place from the local scouting organization. What it actually looked like was little more than just a field next to the river, surrounded by a forest.<br><br><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/17741570638"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7735/17741570638_58c1c5ff82_o.jpg" width="100%"></a><br>The camp is set. What&#x27;s next?&quot; - A short briefing at the campsite during the Packrafting Weekend 2015. Once the camp was set, there were s few points that had to be discussed, one of them being drinking water. Even though the campsite was on the river.<br><br>
