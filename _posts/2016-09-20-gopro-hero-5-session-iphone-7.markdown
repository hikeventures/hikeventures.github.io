Recently, GoPro announced it's new GoPro Hero5 Black and it's GoPro Hero5 Session and I was wondering if there is actually a need to buy any of those GoPro cameras if you can also buy a more or less waterproof IPhone 7?

## Waterproofness
The GoPro cameras are waterproof down to 10 meters while the iPhone 7 can be submerged 1 meter for half an hour (IP67). 

## 4K Video Quality
The iPhone 7 can record 4K at 30fps while the GoPro Hero5 cameras can record 30 frames per second.

## Picture Quality
The iPhone has a 12MP camera with an ƒ/1.8 aperture while the GoPro Hero5 Black has a 12MP camera and the GoPro Hero5 Session has a 10 MP camera with ƒ/2.8.

## Video stabilization
The GoPro5 Black, GoPro Session and the iPhone have image stabilization.

# Conclusion
Looking at the specifications you can certainly get better pictures with the iPhone 7. The video features are more or less the same and the higher aperture on the GoPro should not make a significant difference during daylight. 

So which one should you buy? If you are more into hardcore adventures then the GoPro might still be the better choice especially if you are into diving or any water sports. Having IP67 on the iPhone is nice but let's face it if you fall or jump into a lake you may sink deeper than 1 meter and a GoPro is more affordable than an iPhone 7 in case it would brake.

Certainly, you will also get more scratches on your iPhone 7 screen which is much larger than the camera lens of the GoPro Hero5 Black / Session. 

The iPhone 7 is more for activities which does not involve a lot of shaking since it does not have any built in video stabilization. However, for activities like hiking, backpacking or mountaineering I see the iPhone 7 as a better option than the GoPro 5 Black or Session.

If audio recording is not important to you then you can also get the older <a href="http://amzn.to/2cDRqEi" rel="nofollow">GoPro Session</a> instead and safe some money.
