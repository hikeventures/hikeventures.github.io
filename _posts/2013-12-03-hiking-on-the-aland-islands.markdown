This weekend I went to K&ouml;kar, a Swedish speaking municipality with a population of 244 and is part of the &Aring;land Islands (belonging to Finland) which are located between Finland and Sweden. The &Aring;land islands can be reached by ferry from Turku within 2.5 hours.

The &Aring;land Islands are part of the Finnish Archipelago and are one of the most popular sailing places of the Northern countries. There is also a ferry connection ([Viking Line][1] and [TallinkSilja][2]) from Turku and Stockholm connecting the &Aring;land Islands  (via Mariehamn)  to the main land. The majority of the population speaks Swedish as their native language.

## Transportation

Waiting for the ferry. The transportation is arranged by [Ålandstrafiken][3] where you can also find a price list in case you are planning to travel by car. There are also free ferry connections between the islands.

Even so the weather was sunny we felt quite chilly due to the strong wind on board.

We saw plenty of sailing boats on our ferry trip as this area is very popular among sailors.

The &Aring;land islands are not just popular among sailors but also a popular bicycling destination.

I have stayed over night in <a href="http://www.brudhall.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Brudh&#228;ll</a> but of course there are also possibilities to camp in your tent in Kökar.

Some Hotels also do have an own harbour for their guests.

## Culture

One of the highlights of the island is the <a href="http://www.kyrkor.ax/churches/kokar-church/" target="_blank"> church of St. Anne</a> which was built in 1784 and there is also a Bronze Age site dating back to 1150 BC.

Model ships are also quite popular in churches nearby the coast in Finland and Sweden.

Midsummer pole - they look quite similar in Sweden and Finland.

## Hiking

Map which I found on the trail

There is a lot of variety in the landscape even so you are on an island. There is the sea on the one hand and then on the other hand you have forests and bushes.

Orienteering - Where to go next?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/9173907500"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7428/9173907500_aa9e7734fb_h.jpg" width="1150" ></a>

Marked trails can also be found on the &Aring;land islands

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/8196629575" title="Bog cotton in Finland"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8196629575_62208a3f8a_h.jpg" width="1150" alt="Bog cotton in Finland"></a>
Bog cotton is also quite common - this plant is usually growing in a swamp

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/9173915726"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3669/9173915726_fc07447301_h.jpg" width="1600" height="790" ></a>

Again, forest, bushes and the sea.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/9173916708"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5333/9173916708_40a6efea41_h.jpg" width="1150" ></a>

The weather was quite nasty at some point.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/9173917748"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5541/9173917748_01001c7b96_h.jpg" width="1150" ></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/9171640127"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2814/9171640127_2667775e27_h.jpg" width="1150" ></a>

After my hiking trip, I went back to the harbour and returned to Turku.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/9171639315"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7394/9171639315_a31eb2fbf1_h.jpg" width="1150" ></a>

The Aland Islands are great for hiking and cycling. It's also not too demanding since the islands are rather flat. The Aland Islands is also a great adventure for the whole family. Definitely worth a visit!
