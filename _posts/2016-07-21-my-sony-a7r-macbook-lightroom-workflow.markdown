Today, I would like to present my planned workflow using the Sony A7, Samsung T3, Lightroom and the Macbook Pro 2016 (once it will be released) - propably the lightest full frame package to date.<br><br>

I purchased my <a href="http://amzn.to/2d46BsB" rel="nofollow">Sony A7</a> a few months ago. The Sony A7 is a real bargain compared to the more expensive <a href="http://amzn.to/2dFsEoM" rel="nofollow">Sony A7RII</a>. At the moment I don't need 4K and burst speed is also not important for me. So there is actually no reason for me to pay 2000 EUR more for a camera.

My lens collection consists of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2e2gvHo" rel="nofollow">Samyang 14mm f2.8</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5khks" rel="nofollow">Zeiss Batis 25mm f2</a> and currently I am saving for the <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5ktQM" rel="nofollow">Sony 70-200 f4</a>. The Samyang is a real bargain compared to the other two lenses but you get a pretty good image quality with it. Some people had some issues with the durability of the Samyang but for me it's just a play around lens. Usually, I have my Zeiss Batis 25mm on my Sony A7.

Previously, I also had the <a href="http://amzn.to/1widRB9" rel="nofollow">Sony 35mm F2.8 Sonnar T* FE ZA</a> but the Zeiss Batis is much nicer and with 25mm you have more creative possibilities from my point of view.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15594218195" title="Sony A7r &amp; Slik Mini-Pro III"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15594218195_4e43a0d278_b.jpg" width="738" height="1024" alt="Sony A7r &amp; Slik Mini-Pro III"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In my planned workflow (once the Macbook Pro 2016 has been released), I am going to connect my A7 (above mounted on a <a href="http://amzn.to/1vIdMYC" rel="nofollow">Slik Mini-Pro III</a> tripod) with my Macbook Pro with a USB cable to transfer the files from my <a href="http://amzn.to/2eaj3bq" rel="nofollow">32 GB SanDisk Extreme Pro UHS-II</a> SD card to my Macbook Pro (I prefer this way rather than pulling the SD card in and out). The Sony A7 does not support UHS-II so you can also buy a <a href="http://amzn.to/2dFvf1Y" rel="nofollow">cheaper SD card</a>. However, there is a chance that I will buy a camera in the future which supports UHS-II and then I will be covered.

Next, I open Lightoom which I have configured to auto import images and videos from the A7 to my external <a href="http://amzn.to/2dFw5vv" rel="nofollow">Samsung T3</a> SSD hard drive which is connected with a USB-C cable to my Macbook Pro.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15408236697/in/photostream/" title="Bluelounge CableBin"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3945/15408236697_2252459cc4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bluelounge CableBin"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While importing files into Lightroom, I also create smart preview files for each picture which are saved together with my Lightroom catalog on my external <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5l0Cd" rel="nofollow">Samsung T1</a> which I dedicated exclusively to Lightroom. In general you only need to have the lightroom catalogue on a fast drive but having everything on one single SSD drive is probably the most convenient method.

After importing my files, I start sorting my pictures in Adobe Lightroom and delete those pictures where my manual focusing didn't work (since a couple of months I prefer doing manual rather than autofocus). Then I add tags and import my GPS tacklog data from my <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5ms7L" rel="nofollow">Suunto Traverse</a> into Adobe Lightroom. Lightroom uses this data to apply reverse geocoding on my pictures, which means that it translates GPS data into a readable address.

Finally, I save the new metadata and Lightroom adds the data to an XMP sidecar file on each picture. During the export process in Lightroom I may also attach a watermark on my pictures which I then upload to flickr. To be on the safe side, I also backup my data via Time Machine on a second hard drive like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eacWng" rel="nofollow">Synology DS216+II</a> or the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dgPsu7" rel="nofollow">WD My Cloud Pro</a> (those devices do not have USB-C so you need an <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5nLDl" rel="nofollow">adapter</a>).

If you are using Adobe Cloud then the <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5mRqy" rel="nofollow">	
WD 2TB My Passport Wireless Pro</a> might be also a nice solution to stream your files wirelessly on all your devices.

## Conclusion
There are several ways to transfer your files and work with them. The process described above is just my personal preference. You could also create a similar workflow with less expensive hard drives but the ones I mentioned in this article are currently my personal favorites even so they might be a bit expensive.
