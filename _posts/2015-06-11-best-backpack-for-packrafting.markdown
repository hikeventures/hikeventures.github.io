Having used the HMG Porter 4400 for the last 2 years for my packrafting activities, I was interested to see what other backpacks there are currently on the market which are suitable for packrafting. My current backpack is made of Cuben Fiber. However, I would be interested to try out a backpack where the body of the backpack is a removable dry bag. In case I would get a puncture into my backpack I could easily replace the dry bag. This would be a cheaper and maybe more environmentally friendly solution in the long run.

## Features of a good packrafting backpack
From my point of view a good packrafting backpack should have the following features:

* waterproof 
* durable
* proper carrying system with a hip belt
* fast drying and comfortable shoulder straps
* offers the possibility to attach your paddles
* pockets (e.g. for your water bottle)
* lightweight
* attachable to your packraft

## Deals or Full price?
It's always a good idea to check if there are some deals available. You can try our [price comparison tool](http://www.hikeventures.com/deals/ "Price Comparison") to find the best price offered by several outdoor stores across the U.S.

## HMG Windrider 4400
The HMG Windrider is similar as the HMG Porter 4400 but comes already with three mesh pockets which I find quite useful if you want to quickly store some gear.

Weight: 992 grams  
Volume: 70l  
Fabric: 15D Cuben Fiber  

You can check out the HMG Windrider on the [HMG website](http://bit.ly/1IyJksY "HMG").

## HMG Porter 4400
This is my current backpack with a volume of 70l. It felt comfortable to carry also on longer distances but after 2 years it shows some wear and has a couple of punctures. The HMG Porter is made of Cuben Fiber but I am not sure if I should get another one since I found the fabric not that durable and with punctures on my backpack the backpack loses it's main feature - being waterproof. 

Weight: 1065 grams  
Volume: 70l  
Fabric: 15D Cuben Fiber

You can check out the HMG Porter on the [HMG website](http://bit.ly/1IyJ8dq "HMG").

## Sea to Summit Hydraulic Dry Pack
The Sea to Summit Hydraulic Dry Packs looked to me as an interesting alternative to my HMG backpack until I realised that the carrying system could be a problem. It does not have a proper back panel which might be an issue when carrying your backpack over longer distances.

Weight: 1319 grams  
Volume: 90l  
Fabric: 600D TPU laminated fabric

## ULA Epic
The ULA Epic seems to be the best choice beside the NRS Paragon Pack if I want to have a backpack where I can exchange the dry bag. The ULA Epic is quite flexible and you can attach a 30-75l dry back on it. Having had a 70l pack before the additional 5l on a 75l dry back would come quite handy on an extended trip where I have to carry loads of food and my camera with me. The additional pockets on the ULA Epic also add another 9l of volume to the pack.

Weight: 922 grams (without dry sack)  
Volume: 30-75l  

You can find the ULA Epic [here](http://www.ula-equipment.com/product_p/epic.htm "ULA Epic").

## NRS Paragon Pack
The NRS Paragon Pack is quite versatile like the ULA Epic and you can use smaller and bigger dry bags with it as well as you can read in the [Q&A section](http://www.nrs.com/product/2933/nrs-paragon-pack2 "NRS Paragon Pack"). The straps on the back of the NRS Paragon Pack also look like you can attach your paddles to the backpack.

Weight: 1179 grams (without dry sack)
