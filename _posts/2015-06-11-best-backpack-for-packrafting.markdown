In this artcile I would like to present the best backpacks with are available for packrafting. Having used the [HMG Porter 4400](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/4400-porter.html)  for the last 3 years on my packrafting trips I was interested to see which alternatives would be available on the market. Gernerally, speaking I was not able to find any alternative to the [HMG Porter 4400](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/4400-porter.html) which is that light and feels like a proper backpack when I bought it. So let's see what other options are available nowadays.

# Features of a good packrafting backpack

From my point of view a good packrafting backpack should have the following features:

* waterproof 
* durable
* proper carrying system with a hip belt
* fast drying and comfortable shoulder straps
* offers the possibility to attach your paddles
* pockets (e.g. for your water bottle)
* lightweight
* attachable to your packraft

## [HMG Windrider 4400](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/4400-windrider.html)
The HMG Windrider is similar as the HMG Porter 4400 but comes already with three mesh pockets which I find quite useful if you want to quickly store some gear.

**Weight:** 992 grams  
**Volume:** 70l  
**Fabric:** 15D Cuben Fiber

## [HMG Porter 4400](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/4400-porter.html)
This is my current backpack with a volume of 70l. It felt comfortable to carry also on longer distances but after 2 years it shows some wear and has a couple of punctures. The HMG Porter is made of Cuben Fiber but I am not sure if I should get another one since I found the fabric not that durable and with punctures on my backpack the backpack loses it's main feature - being waterproof. 

**Weight:** 1065 grams  
**Volume:** 70l  
**Fabric:** 15D Cuben Fiber

## [Sea to Summit Hydraulic Dry Pack](http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-hydraulic-dry-pack)
The Sea to Summit Hydraulic Dry Packs looked to me as an interesting alternative to my HMG backpack until I realised that the carrying system could be a problem. It does not have a proper back panel which might be an issue when carrying your backpack over longer distances.

**Weight:** 1319 grams  
**Volume:** 90l  
**Fabric:** 600D TPU laminated fabric

## [ULA Epic](http://www.ula-equipment.com/product_p/epic.htm?avad=150351_eb5dd49b)
The ULA Epic seems to be the best choice beside the NRS Paragon Pack if I want to have a backpack where I can exchange the dry bag. The ULA Epic is quite flexible and you can attach a 30-75l dry back on it. Having had a 70l pack before the additional 5l on a 75l dry back would come quite handy on an extended trip where I have to carry loads of food and my camera with me. The additional pockets on the ULA Epic also add another 9l of volume to the pack.

**Weight:** 922 grams (without dry sack)  
**Volume:** 30-75l

## [NRS Paragon Pack](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/product_NRS-Paragon-Pack_10275460_10208_10000001_-1_)
The NRS Paragon Pack is quite versatile like the ULA Epic and you can use smaller and bigger dry bags with it as well as you can read in the [Q&A section](http://www.nrs.com/product/2933/nrs-paragon-pack2 "NRS Paragon Pack"). The straps on the back of the NRS Paragon Pack also look like you can attach your paddles to the backpack.

**Weight:** 1179 grams (without dry sack)

# Conclusion
My favourite backpack is still the [HMG Porter 4400](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/4400-porter.html) and I use it since 3 years as my packrafting backpack. I did not have any issues with it so far. There are just a few small spots which are wearing off but it would have happen to any other backpack as well.
