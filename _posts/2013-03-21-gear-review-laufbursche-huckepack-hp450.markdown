I was searching for a new ultralight backpack for my hiking, backpacking and packrafting trips and came accross the Laufbursche Huckepack which is manufactured in Germany and here comes a short review. The 450 grams and 40/52l Laufbursche Huckepack seems to be a perfect solution for a UL backpack and its' quality seems to be good too. It's also possible to have a custom made backpack as you can see in the pictures below. I chose a material which is slightly more heavy but more durable.

This is how I got the backpack. I ordered the cuben fibre bag separately. The water plastic bottle came free of charge. I found the packaging really good and there is also a leaflet included how to handle the backpack.

There is a bag on the top of the backpack where you can store your money, keys, passport, etc.

The backpack also features a whistle.

The hip belt is quite light too but seems to be perfect for the weight the backpack is made for.

## Recommendation
The Laufbursche Huckepack is a great backpack for Ultralight adventures or if you go on a shorter trip. The fabrics and craftsmanship is on a very high level. Do you have a packraft or need more space? Then you might also consider the <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hmg-porter-4400-black/" target="_self">HMG Porter 4400</a>.

## Update 10.5.2013
One loop was missing on the Laufbursche Huckepack when I received it. However, got the Laufbursche Huckepack fixed without any issues after I have sent it back (PLUS a titanium spoon for free!!!). Very happy about the Laufbursche customer service!
