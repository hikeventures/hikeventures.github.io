Last year we spent four days trekking in the Northern Alps of Japan - one of the most beautiful natural settings in Japan - which was a really special way to start our holidays.

Crossing one of a dozen of bridges on the Odai-Ga-Hara trail | Extremely beautiful, this trail is not for people who are afraid of heights.
