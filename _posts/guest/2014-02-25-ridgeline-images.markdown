Ridgeline Images is about hiking in Japan and wilderness exploration, though mostly focused on day and overnight outings. My main impetus for getting this blog started was frustration with the lack of information in English on hiking trails around Tokyo.

Over the past year I have relished the opportunity to document my experiences and realised the enjoyment that comes from journeying into the backcountry. If you have a chance please check out some of my outdoor adventures or drop me a line if you have any questions about about hiking in Japan.
 
Happy and safe travels!
