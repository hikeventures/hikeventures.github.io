In 2011 Fran Reisner, an international award winning photographer and speaker, embarked on an adventure that many dream about but few see to fruition when she sold her home, her portrait studio, and most of her possessions to purchase a motorhome and travel the country. Her goals were simple; to simplify life, enjoy traveling without strings, and pursue her love of photography and passion for life in a fresh new way.

Since then Fran has traveled more than 35,000 miles throughout 47 of the continental United States and parts of Canada with her loveable rescue mutts Jazzy and Sadie. With camera in hand she has hiked hundreds of trails and kayaked many waterways, documenting the never-ending beauty of nature along the way. Fran shares her adventurous tales, breathtaking images and loads of inspiration on her blog site, <a href="http://www.JourneyInFocus.com" target="_blank">www.JourneyInFocus.com</a>.
