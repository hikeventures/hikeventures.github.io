For my packrafting trips I was looking for shoes which I can wear together with my dry suite and I came across the KEEN EVOFIT ONE. KEEN provided my a pair of test sandals and I took them with me on my 3 days packrafting trip in <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/finnish-packrafting-meetup-teijo/">Teijo National Park</a> in Finland.

## The idea behind the sandals

The KEEN EVOFIT ONE incorporates a new technology developed by KEEN which the company describes as an evolution in form, fit and function. KEEN describes it as a second skin which moves and breathes with your foot.

## Technology
EVOFIT comes with a 4-way dynamic stretch that moves fluidly on your skin, protects and adapts based on the movement of your foot. The sandals are made to be used in and out of the water, for jungle trails and river rocks - so it seems that they are could be a great solution for packrafting as well. Moreover, they are also protecting your toes.

<br>

## First impression
Without having properly tested them, the sandals feel very comfortable to wear and I am quite confident that they should also handle longer walking distances quite well.

<br>
The sandals are also reinforced around the ankle for increased security.

<br>
The sandals can also be tightened with a strap.

The contoured arch on the sole supports your foot arch as well.

<br>
The rubber sole looks like it can handle challenging situations.

## First test

My personal impression about the KEEN EVOFIT ONE during a three days packrafting trip was quite positive. They are really comfortable to walk with and they were an excellent addition to my dry suit which requires to wear shoes to protect the waterproof socks. Below you can see me inflating a packraft wearing my KEEN EVOFIT ONE. For me it's important to have shoes or sandals which are not slippery on wet stones.

<br>
Moreover, I also liked the toe protection on the shoe which can be quite important when walking over rocks or roots.

<br>
One positive aspect on the KEEN EVOFIT ONE is that it has a strap to tighten in on your foot. In my past trips, I always got stuck in the mud with my sandals and lost even one of them when doing whitewater rescue training on the Soca river in Slovenia.

<br>
The tightening strap helps to keep the sandal on your foot, however, there is still a chance that the sandal may get stuck when walking within on mud.

Talking about drying. I had the shoes hang on a tree to dry over the night but the material still felt a bit wet.

However, I suppose that this was more related to the moist which the shoe collects during the night and in the morning. I still need to test how long it would take to dry for the sandal if I expose it directly to the sun and update this article in the future once I have more experience with these sandals.
