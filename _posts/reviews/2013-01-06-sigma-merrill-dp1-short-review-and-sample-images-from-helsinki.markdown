I just returned from Helsinki and want to share my first pictures with you which I took with my new Sigma Merrill DP1.

The Sigma Merrill DP1 with its 340 grams is super light and has a superb image quality due to its prime lens (which can unfortunately not be exchanged with any other lens) and special Foveon sensor. However, this camera is not suited for those having action photography in mind. I bought this camera mainly for landscape photography. Since the image files are so big, you can easily zoom into the picture and still get a sharp image out of the crop. However, I would recommend to buy the optional AC Adapter SAC-5 and an

## Features
Since the Sigma Merrill has a fixed lens it comes with a cheaper price. It also is quite lightweight and takes pictures with good image quality.
