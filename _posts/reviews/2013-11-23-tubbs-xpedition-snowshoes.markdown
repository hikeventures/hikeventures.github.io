Having used skis and hiking boots the years before, I am interested to do some snowshoeshoeing this winter with my new Tubbs Xpedition snowshoes and here comes a short review. As I have worked in the past a couple of months in a mountain hut in the Swiss Alps, I frequently had to walk 2 hours up the mountain to reach my workplace. Well, it was possible but with snowhoes it would have been so much more easier to get up.

## How to wear the Snowshoes?
The binding of the snowshoes are easy to use. Just slip in with your shoes and tighten the straps. Wearing a pair of light mountain shoes and breathable long pants over it should be sufficient. Gaiters might be a useful too - especially when walking in deep powder snow.

## Recommendation
The Tubbs Xpedition snowshoes seems to be a solid product for backcountry usage. There might be also products from other brands to consider like the <a href="http://award.ispo.com/en/Winner-2014/Products/Outdoor/Snowshoes/MSR/" target="_blank">MSR Revo Explore snowshoe</a> which also won the ISPO Award 2014. Alternatively, if you are low on budget, you could also consider snowshoe models on the lower end of the price range and upgrade later on.
