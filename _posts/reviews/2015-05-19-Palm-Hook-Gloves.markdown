After we had some quality issues with our previous packrafting gloves, we decided to get the Palm Hook gloves for our packrafting trips in spring and autumn.

The Palm Hook gloves are made of 3 mm Thermo Fibre lined Titanium CR neoprene. They feel quite comfortable to wear and are easy to put on / off. The fabric actually reflects body heat back to the fingers keeping them more warm than average neoprene gloves.

Further, there is also a velcro adjustable cuff on the Palm Hook to tighten the glove. What's more, the glove has pre-bended fingers so holding the paddles is much more relaxed. I also like the the grip of the gloves.

The gloves are also not that heavy with a weight of 72 grams.

Let's see how they are going to perform in our upcoming trips ...
