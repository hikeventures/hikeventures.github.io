Having used my old 10 EUR bag which I have used the last 2 years, I decided to upgrade the bag I am using for traveling and transporting my outdoor gear. After reviewing several options, I went for the North Face Base Camp Duffle L, which was on sale during Easter and here comes a short review.

## Recommendation
I use the North Face Base Camp Duffle mainly to transport my gear between airports. So far, the bag gives a solid impression and worked quite well for me. If I would were to buy a Duffle again I would take the largest size to cram in even more stuff especially if you also need clothes which are not related to your hiking trip.
