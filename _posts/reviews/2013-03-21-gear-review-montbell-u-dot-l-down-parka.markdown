The Montbell U.L. Down Parka seems to be a perfect addition if you are planning to use a quilt instead of a sleeping bag during spring, summer and autumn. The down parka is super light and has a 800 fill. It also features a DWR treatment, YKK zippers and an adjustable hood. This is my current down jacket on my hiking, backpacking and other backcountry trips and here comes a short review.

## Features
The Montbell UL Down Parka weights 260 grams and comes with 800 cuin goose down. It also has a DWR treatment andcomes in a 15-denier ballistic airlight nylon shell to keep the down dry if it's very moisture however this jacket is not waterproof.

## Recommendation
The Montbell U.L. Down Parka is great for anything where you are not active to keep you warm during 3-season (e.g. sitting in the camp in the evenings). There are also plenty of down jackets available which have even better down quality. I also wear it as an extra layer if my sleeping bag is not sufficient or as a mid-layer during the winter.

If you need a real winter down jacket then the <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/rab-positron-down-jacket-mens">Rab Positron Jacket</a> would currently be my favorite winter down jacket.

Still not sure which down jacket to buy? Here is a list of my <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/best-down-jackets/">favorite down jackets</a> which I would currently buy as a 3- and 4-season down jacket.
