Last year I was in need to find new hiking pants for my trips. I was looking for pants which would be suitable to wear in the mountains but also while packrafting. I was talking to a Lundhags representative and he suggested me to try the Lundhags Makke pants. The name Makke derives from a mountain in Jämtland in Sweden called Makkene which should probably reflect the environment where the Makke pant can be worn.

# Field Testing
I was worn the Lundhags Makke Pant this year on the [Swedish Packrafting Gathering](http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/), on smaller trips around Turku and on a trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/) and in [Northern Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/Finnmark/). The areas I have visited are quite different. In Finnish Lapland I was packrafting and hiking in forests and through swamps while in Norway I was climbing on hills and were exposed to strong winds.
