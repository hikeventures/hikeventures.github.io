Last year we were in need to find new hiking pants for our trips so I was looking for pants which would be suitable to wear in the mountains but also while packrafting. I was talking to a Lundhags representative and he suggested me to try the Lundhags Makke pants. The name Makke derives from a mountain in Jämtland in Sweden called Makkene which should probably reflect the environment where the Makke pant can be worn. The pictures in this review show Konstantin who was wearing the Makke pant this year on his trips in Japan, Russia and Sweden.

# Field Testing
I was wearing the Lundhags Makke Pant this year on the [Swedish Packrafting Gathering](http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/), on smaller trips around Turku and on a trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/Kaldoaivi/) and in [Northern Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/Finnmark/). The areas I have visited were quite different. In Finnish Lapland I was packrafting and hiking in forests and through swamps while in Norway I was climbing on hills and were exposed to strong winds. The Makke Pant works especially good when you are in the mountains since it is made of a stretch fabric. Moving up and down felt more comfortable to me than with pants having no stretch fabric.

What I also liked were the side zippers of the pants. They are quite useful if you have to put on hiking boots with a higher shaft of if you want to roll them up if you have to cross a river.

The Makke pant also has venting zippers on the inner tights. If the temperatures are high or if you have to walk up a mountain or a hill you can open those vents to allow air flowing in to cool your legs. The result is a more pleasant hiking experience.

Moreover, the Makke pant has also zippers on the leg and hand pockets, pre-shaped knees, hem adjustment and a boot hook and weights 436 grams which I found a good weight for such a fully featured pants. One advantage is that you don’t need any belt since the Makke pant comes with an adjustment strap at the waistband.

# Fabric
The Lundhags Makke Pant fabric consists of LPC (Lundhags PolyCotton) stretch - 65% Polyester and 35% Cotton (FC Free DWR) 181 g/m². The stretch fabric is made by Schoeller Dry Skin which consists of 52% Polyamid, 41% Polyamid (micro) and 7% Elastane. The reinforcements are made of Schoeller Keprotec which are PFOA/PFOS free.

# Conclusion
Currently, the Lundhags Makke are my favorite pants. I like that they are stretchy and that they also dry reasonably fast since they are not made solely of cotton. The vent zippers on the inner tights are great and the zippers on the pockets will make sure that you don’t lose anything stored in your pockets.  Those pants also work quite well if you are planning to wear them with [shell boots](http://www.hikeventures.com/Lundhags-Jaure-Light/).
