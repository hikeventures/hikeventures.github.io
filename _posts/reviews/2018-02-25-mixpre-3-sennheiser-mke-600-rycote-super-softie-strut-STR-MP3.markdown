In this blog post I would like to introduce you to my mobile audio recording equipment - the <a href="http://amzn.to/2BPlHgO" rel="nofollow">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2FthLSA" rel="nofollow">
Sennheiser MKE 600</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2EPLurN" rel="nofollow">
Rycote Super Softie</a> and the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1345021-REG/strut_str_mp3_custom_fit_field_case.html/BI/19674/KBID/12320/kw/STRMP3/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xSTRMP3" target="_blank">Strut STR-MP3</a>.

Currently, I am also using a <a href="http://amzn.to/2CICizM" rel="nofollow">
AKG N60</a> as my headset. However, I am planning to replace it with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2GKjiDn" rel="nofollow">
Sennheiser HD-25-1 II</a>, which is considered as one of the industry standard audio recording headphones.

What I really like on the Strut STR-MP3 is its small footprint. It packs really small and the MixPre-3 fits perfectly in it. I am also able to attach 2 <a href="http://amzn.to/2HLk9Vu">Rode Newsshooter Kit</a> transmitters to the front of the bag. Unfortunately, the bag is only available in the US but it's possible to get it shipped to Europe as well. The bag is really nice and looks in real much nicer than what you see on some websites.

To power the MixPre-3 I use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2FvBIs9">4 AA Panasonic eneloop pro</a> batteries and a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2HKFH4Q">Anker PowerCore+ 20100 USB-C</a> battery. As I like to be able to recharge my eneloop pro batteries I also got an <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2F5Gu1A">EBL 40Min iQuick Smart USB Individual battery charger</a>.

Here you can see the Sennheiser MKE 600 mounted on my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2FuHJFx">SLIK Mini Pro III</a>. The SLIK tripod is one of my favorite tripods as it packs small and can carry small and big cameras as well as microphones. I also use it at home on my desk with the MixPre-3 mounted on it.
