In this blog post I would like to introduce you to my mobile audio recording equipment - the <a href="http://amzn.to/2BPlHgO" >Sound Devices MixPre-3</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2FthLSA" >
Sennheiser MKE 600</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2EPLurN" >
Rycote Super Softie</a> and the <a   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1345021-REG/strut_str_mp3_custom_fit_field_case.html/BI/19674/KBID/12320/kw/STRMP3/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xSTRMP3" target="_blank">Strut STR-MP3</a>. I am not an professional when it comes to audio but just started with it as a hobby. There is also a [MixPre-3 preset](http://cdn.sounddevices.com/download/guides/MixPreSeries-SonyA7SR.pdf) available in case you want to syncronize your camera with the Timecode of the MixPre-3.

I would also be interested to record stereo sound in the future with 2 dedicated Microphones like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2EPwc6G">Audio-Technica AT4022 Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone</a> on an Olson Wing array or even the <a  href="http://amzn.to/2CJpVmU">Sennheiser Ambeo VR mic</a>.

Currently, I am also using a <a href="http://amzn.to/2CICizM" >
AKG N60</a> as my headset. However, I am planning to replace it with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2GKjiDn" >
Sennheiser HD-25-1 II</a>, which is considered as one of the industry standard audio recording headphones.

The Sound Devices MixPre-3 is an audio recorder which is a bit more on the expensive side. However, the built quality is excellent and I was also told by Sound Devices that it could take a few splashes (but was recommended to buy an additional bag for it to be on the safe side).

Usually, I am operating the device in basic mode. There is also an advanced mode but then you have to adjust quite a bit by yourself. I was also told by Sound Devices that an increased sampling rate of 192 kHz is on the wish list of many MixPre-3 users. So there might be a chance that the sampling rate will be increased through a firmware update in the future.

Nevertheless, I am not sure if the human ear can actually hear a difference between 96 kHz and 192 kHz.

What I really like on the Strut STR-MP3 is its small footprint. It packs really small and the MixPre-3 fits perfectly in it. I am also able to attach 2 <a href="http://amzn.to/2HLk9Vu">Rode Newsshooter Kit</a> transmitters to the front of the bag.

Unfortunately, the bag is only available in the US but it's possible to get it shipped to Europe as well. The bag is really nice and looks in real much nicer than what you see on some websites. Initially, I was more leaning towards the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1371251-REG/k_tek_kstgmix_stingray_mixpro_bag_for.html/BI/19674/KBID/12320/kw/KTKSTGMIX/DFF/d10-v2-t1-xKTKSTGMIX" target="_blank" >K-Tek KSTGMIX Stingray MixPro Audio Bag</a> but then I decided that I wanted to have a big which is 100% tailored to the MixPre-3.

To power the MixPre-3 I use <a  href="http://amzn.to/2FvBIs9">4 AA Panasonic eneloop pro</a> batteries and a <a  href="http://amzn.to/2HKFH4Q">Anker PowerCore+ 20100 USB-C</a> battery. As I like to be able to recharge my eneloop pro batteries I also got an <a  href="http://amzn.to/2F5Gu1A">EBL 40Min iQuick Smart USB Individual battery charger</a>. The cable which connects the MixPre-3 with my Sennheiser MKE 600 is the <a  href="http://amzn.to/2HKNz6o">Mogami GOLD STUDIO-03 XLR Microphone Cable</a>.

Here you can see the Sennheiser MKE 600 mounted on my <a  href="http://amzn.to/2FuHJFx">SLIK Mini Pro III</a> together with the <a  href="http://amzn.to/2F8plEN">Rycote InVision Video Mic Lyre</a> shockmount.

The SLIK tripod is one of my favorite tripods as it packs small and can carry small and big cameras as well as microphones. I also use it at home on my desk with the MixPre-3 mounted on it.

You can get the Sound Devices MixPre-3 on <a  href="https://amzn.to/2Okn5vG">Amazon</a>.
