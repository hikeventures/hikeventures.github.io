Last year I was looking for a new sleeping bag to replace my [Cumulus Panjam 450][1] and here is a first review about the Western Mountaineering Versalite - a 3-season sleeping bag.

In general, I was quite happy with the Cumulus Panjam 450. However, after having had my new Western Mountaineering Versalite on a few trips, changing back to the Cumulus Panjam 450 would be not such an easy step for me.

Why? Because I feel much warmer in the WM Versalite. However, the Cumulus Panjam 450 is by no means a bad sleeping bag and they have also a model which is filled with more down.

## Field Testing
 I have used my WM Versalite on several trips for example in Finland when we were packsailing to the [fortress island of Örö][2] or on our winter and summer trip in [Northern Norway][3] (see pictures in this blog post).

Talking about our winter trip in Northern Norway, I had an additional lighter sleeping bag with me which I used within the WM Versalite as we had temperatures at night of about -8C.

You are probably also interested to know in what I was wearing during the night. Well, I was wearing a merino base layer and a synthetic insulated jacket during the night.

However, it was slightly too warm wearing a jacket and being covered with 2 sleeping bags as I wanted to make sure to wear enough clothes during the night as I was not sure how deep the temperatures would drop.

However, as a 3 season sleeping bag I would argue that the WM Versalite is probably one of the best sleeping bags I have used so far. The sleeping bag is also not advertised as being a winter sleeping bag but I prefer to layer rather than buying a dedicated winter sleeping bag.

## Features
Now lets get to the specifications of the Western Mountaineering Versalite.   

The Versalite can handle temperatures down to -12 C (10F). Probably I feel cold quite fast but I would say that I feel comfortable with this sleeping bag down to -2C.

The sleeping bag is filled with 567 grams (20oz.) down and weights 900 grams (2lbs.). The down is rated as 850+.

It features continuous baffles so you can adjust the down within the sleeping bag according to your needs. The full collar also helps to keep your body heat within the sleeping bag.

## Conclusion
There is not much to complain about the Western Mountaineering Versalite. I like the design and the quality and it’s easily my favourite sleeping bag at the moment. I will probably look into a summer sleeping bag from WM as well.

However, for Scandinavia this is easily a great sleeping bag which can be used during 3 seasons and even during the winter if it’s not that cold or you layer it with another sleeping bag if you are tight on budget to get a dedicated winter sleeping bag.

A great sleeping pad companion for the WM Versalite is the <a href="http://amzn.to/2og8uXo" rel="nofollow">Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a> which weights about 400 grams and which I have also used in Northern Norway (see picture above).
