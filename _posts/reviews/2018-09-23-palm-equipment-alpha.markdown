When it comes to any paddle sport, one of the essentials for white water safety is your personal flotation device or a PFD for short. There are different types of PFDs that you can choose from (all sorts of shapes, colours and sizes, in fact) and there are different reasons why you would like to choose one or another.

It’s not only about the amount of flotation that it gives (though it is a very important point to consider, no doubt about that), but also about the comfort of wearing it, the freedom of movement, its colour and extras (e.g., pockets or a knife lash tab) and, what is especially important for packrafting, its weight. And the Alpha by Palm Equipment is exactly what I personally searched for in a packrafting PFD. Here is why.

Let me start by talking about the floatation, which, to a certain extent, should be treated more as a prerequisite. The Alpha PFD has EN ISO 12402-5 / 12402-6 certification, in which the first number refers to Buoyancy aids (level 50), which International Organization for Standartization (ISO) describes as “buoyancy aids with a buoyancy of not less than 50 N used in sheltered waters with help and rescue close at hand under such circumstances where more bulky or buoyant devices can impair the user's activity.”

Thus, this PFD has at least 5.1 kg (11.2 lbs) of buoyancy as 1 newton equals 102 grams. In fact, the International Canoe Federation (ICF) certified it at 6.12 kg (13.49 lbs or 60 N) and accredited it to be used in slalom competition.

Such accreditation means that it should also be enough to use the Alpha PFD for white water packrafting and not to worry if it can help you to keep yourself above the water in case you go for a swim.

And indeed, I weigh around 200 lbs and I have gone swimming dozens of times while wearing this PFD (and not always on purpose), and I never had to question it as it always provided me with enough support.

I can imagine that if I were to paddle even higher class white water (I am usually going for maximum 3+) or if I were to travel in a remote area completely on my own, I might want to get a PFD with even higher buoyancy. But so far, the Alpha PFD has proven to be sufficient.

It is well known that the best PFD is the one you will wear, which is why you need to fine the one you will be comfortable wearing for an extended period of time and do not feel tempted to take it off. It should not restrict your movements either.

And the Alpha PFD is just like that. It is a pullover style PFD with a low profile. Its minimalist design means that it has only the front and the back panels that fit comfortably around the body, leaving a lot of freedom for arm movement. The four side adjustments and two adjustable shoulder straps help to fine-tune the fit.

In some cases, I like to make it snugger, in other case (e.g., on a hot day on flat water) I might make it a bit looser. I have worn it for up to ten hours a day, 5 days in a row and, on the whole, I did not find it disturbing, annoying or uncomfortable.

There are only two minor points that need to be mentioned. The first one is that being a pullover PFD, it is not always very convenient to put the Alpha on or off.

I really need to think of the order – first the spreyskirt (as the one for a packraft has suspenders), then the PFD and only then the helmet. Making sure that you put the skirt first is not so unique for this PFD, but if you have your helmet on, then you cannot slide the PFD that easily over your head. Especially if your helmet has a visor.

The other point is that you need to adjust the PFD every time you put it on. The front-entry or side-entry types have an advantage in this case.

However, this is not really a problem and just a matter of minor inconvenience, which I can easily minimize by adjusting the two straps only on my right side (I am right-handed) and keeping the rest as they are.
