The SteriPen Freedom with its 75 grams is currently the lightest UV pen from SteriPen. We will use this UV pen in combination with a [ceramic water filter][1] to clean the water from possible viruses as well.

## Features
The Steripen Freedom weights only 75 grams and rechargeable via USB (e.g. with a [rechargeable USB battery][2] which you can take on your trip) and is supposed to clean water of bacterias.

## Recommendation
I have used the Steripen Freedom in combination with a ceramic filter in order to achieve the best results. I have tested the Steripen Freedom on our [trip to Sarek][3] in Sweden. However, water filters are in most cases not really needed there but it's still good to filter particles out with a ceramic filter.

You can get the Steripen Freedom on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2w5H7ku" target="_blank" >Amazon</a>. We make a commission for purchases made through the previous link which helps us to keep this blog running.
