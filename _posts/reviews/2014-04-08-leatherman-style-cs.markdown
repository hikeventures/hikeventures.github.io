Alternatively, you may also consider the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/my-three-favourite-hiking-items/" target="_blank">Victorinox Swisslite Pocket Knife</a> if you are looking for a well-known brand beside Leatherman.

The carabiner is quite useful to attach the Leatherman Style CS for example on your backpack as small gear and tools can easily get lost on your hiking trip.

You can get the Leatherman Style on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2uVvttM" target="_blank" >Amazon</a>. We make a commission for purchases made through the previous link which helps us to keep this blog running.
