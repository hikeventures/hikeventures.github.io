If you are looking for really light hiking poles then you should give the Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles a try. They are super portable and light for the summer. Unfortuantely, they are not that suitable for winter activities as you can not attach snow baskets on them.

This is the lock button which you need to push in order to fold the poles.

The mesh bag also comes with the poles. In general, I would say those poles look and feel really great. They also won the Backpacker Editor Choice 2011. I also believe that the Z-Poles work better than the clip system. It also comes with an interchangeable rubber and carbide tips.

## Recommendation
I have tested the Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">our trip to Sarek</a> in Sweden. The lack Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles are light and easy to assemble. They were very supportive especially if you walk up or down a hill with heavy load on your back.
