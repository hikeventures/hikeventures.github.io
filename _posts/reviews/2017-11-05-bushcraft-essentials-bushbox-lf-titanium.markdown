Today, I had a chance to test our new Bushcraft Essentials Bushbox LF Titanium. I was looking for a wood burning stove which comes in a light package and the The Bushbox LF Titanium is probably one of the best stoves which I could find online.

We discovered Bushcraft Essentials this year at the OutDoor Show in Friedrichshafen and were quite excited to test them ourselves. The Bushbox LF Titanium generates good heat, is foldable and weights around 270 grams.

Here you can watch our interviews with Bushcraft Essentials:

The Bushcraft Essentials Fire Piston is actually quite interesting. It has a waterproof compartment where you can store tinder.

After having used the Bushcraft Essentials Bushbox LF Titanium for a few times I would say that I am quite happy with it. It's not a budget stove but you get what you pay for. The quality of this stove is really good.
