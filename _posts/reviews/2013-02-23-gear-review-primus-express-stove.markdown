The <a href="http://www.primus.eu/Templates/Pages/3_cols_white_middle.aspx?SectionId=5888" target="_blank">Primus Express Stove winter</a> has a weight of 82 grams. It packs very small in your backpack and does not cost much. You may also buy a <a href="http://www.primus.eu/Templates/Pages/Product.aspx?ItemId=87476" target="_blank">windshield</a> with it.

The piezo igniter worked quite good at the beginning however for some reason it broke after a while and I would not solely rely on the igniter if you are going on a trip for multiple days. If you are more after efficiency, I would rather recommend the Jetboil Sol Ti.
