This year I am going to enhance my outdoor experience by using an Alpacka Raft Yukon Yak. Even so it weights around 3.5 kg including paddle I believe this is still a weight worth to carry for some additional fun even so if you hike ultralight. Here comes a short unboxing review of the Alpacka Raft Yukon Yak.

The package which I have received from the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/">packrafting store</a> in Germany. To have a feeling for the seize of the package I have placed a shoe next to it.

## Recommendation
If you are looking for a new experience on your hiking trip or if you want to pass a river where there is no bridge, then you should give a thought if a Packraft could be an option for you. It's also quite nice just to float along the river and enjoy the landscape rather than carrying the heavy backpack during your whole trip.
