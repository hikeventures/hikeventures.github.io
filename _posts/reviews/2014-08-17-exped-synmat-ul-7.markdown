Here is a short review about the Exped SynMat UL 7 which is our current sleeping pad since over 1 year and me and Konstantin would like to share our experience in this review with the Exped SynMat UL 7 which has been one of the best 3-season sleeping pads for our hiking, camping, backpacking, packrafting and other outdoor trips.

The SynMat UL 7 M weights around 450 grams, is 183 cm long and has an R-Value of 3.10 (Temperatures down to -4 °C). This means that this sleeping pad is suited for spring, summer and autumn (depending on your location). When I tested this pad I felt a bit cold on my back when the temperatures dropped to 0 °C so I am going to use the Exped UL 7 M only for temperatures of +5 °C and more in the future.

The Exped Synmat UL 7 has two valves - one to inflate and another one to deflate the sleeping pad. Inflating Synmat UL 7 can easily done with your mouth.

Quality and durability of the sleeping pad is also quite good. I have used the Synmat UL 7 quite extensively and it seems that the seam on both of our sleeping pads which divides the air chambers gets a bit lose. Konstantin got his sleeping pad exchanged since it comes with 2 years warranty.

I suppose that issues with seams may be an issue on all sleeping pads over the time. Beside this issue I was quite happy with my Synmat UL 7. Further, you may also need to adapt in case you are are used to vertical air chamber grooves rather than horizontal air chamber grooves.

## Recommendation
I like the Exped Synmat UL 7. It feels comfortable and I would buy it again. However, you might need to evaluate in beforehand if you prefer to sleep on a sleeping pad with vertical air chambers.
