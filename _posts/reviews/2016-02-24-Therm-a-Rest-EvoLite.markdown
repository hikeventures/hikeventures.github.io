Last year we hiking and packrafting in Japan and Sweden and here is a review about the self-inflating Therm-a-Rest EvoLite sleeping pad which we received from Therm-a-Rest.

## EvoLite Specifications
The EvoLite sleeping pad is part of Therm-a-rest’s Fast & Light product line. The EvoLite (regular) weights 520 grams, is 51 cm wide and 183 cm long and 5 cm thick. However, we tested the larger version (196 cm) or the EvoLite. The bottom of the EvoLite is made of 30d mini Rip Polyester. The innovation in this mattress is that it is self-inflating which means that you just have to blow into the valve a couple of times and the EvoLite is ready for the night.

In the picture below you can see what’s included in the EvoLite package. A stuff bag, the sleeping pad and a manual.

## EvoLite Field Testing
We have tested the EvoLite in Japan and Sweden. On the picture below you can see the EvoLite on top of our MSR Hubba NX tent in Japan.

The best way to set up your camp is to get the EvoLite pat out of the stuff bag and then focus on other things (e.g. preparing a meal or pitching the tent) while the EvoLite inflates and add the missing air via the valve into the sleeping pad after a couple of minutes.

We have used the EvoLite indoors and outdoors in Japan. The temperatures in Japan are quite high during the summer and a great place where you could use the EvoLite.

Below Marta on the EvoLite in Japan. Seems that she made a satisfied impression on the EvoLite.

Camping on a beach in Japan.

While Marta enjoyed the EvoLite in Japan, Patrick got his hands on the EvoLite during summer in northern Sweden. Even during the summer, temperatures in northern Sweden may drop quite low and the EvoLite was unfortunately not sufficient to stay warm.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/24944871370/in/dateposted-public/" title="Therm-a-Rest EvoLite"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1601/24944871370_75481daea0_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Therm-a-Rest EvoLite"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, Patrick enjoyed the self-inflating capability of the EvoLite especially after a long paddling day where you don’t want to spend more time than needed to inflate a sleeping pad. The large version (196 cm long) is probably too big for Patrick (180 cm).

## Conclusion
For those who don’t like to inflate sleeping pads, a self-inflating sleeping pad like the EvoLite might be a great solution depending where you are planning to use it. For warmer regions the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZKXB2Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PZKXB2Y&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=DLS6QGB2CPYI6H2G">Therm-a-Rest EvoLite</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00PZKXB2Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is probably a great choice. If you are planning to travel to colder places I would rather take the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TSFYZAE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TSFYZAE&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=WRWW2DWHEYZIT5QG">Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00TSFYZAE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> with me. The XTherm is somewhat lighter than the EvoLite and keeps you warm till deep into minus temperatures. The only downside of the XTherm is however that it is not a self-inflating sleeping pad. However, it can be used in a wider temperature range for almost the same weight.
