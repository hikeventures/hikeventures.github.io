Since I recently purchased a packraft, I realized quickly that my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-laufbursche-huckepack-hp450/" target="_self">Laufbursche Huckepack</a>  is going to be a bit small for a multi-day packrafting trip. So I decided to order a Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter 4400. I have used the Porter for a couple of years and I am quite happy with it as I can use it as an ultralight backpack for hiking, backpacking, packrafting and other backcountry trips. Here is a short review and some pictures of the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter 4400.

After a short discussion with the HMG owner, I was offered a backpack which is made of 150 denier nylon instead of the 50 denier nylon which comes with the regular backpack. Even so the pack is slightly heavier, it should be more durable than the lighter version. Below the pictures of HMG Porter 4400 black incl. the Porter Stuff Pocket.

## Features
The HMG Porter 4400 is more durable than the regular porter. The HMG Porter 4400 is also waterproof and lightweight. It comes with YKK zippers, an emergency whistle and is comfortable to carry. If you are into packrafting then it's also easy to attach a packraft on top of the HMG Porter.

The emergency whistle which comes with the HMP Porter 4400 could be quite useful in case of an emergency.

Inside the backpack you can find a small pocket where you can store money etc.

## Recommendation
I have tested the HMG Porter 4400 for a couple of years on hiking and packrafting trips. On long backpacking trips saving weight is quite important. I wouldn't say that the HMG Porter 4400 is super durable (I got 2 tiny wholes in my backpack after 3 years), however there is hardly any gear available which will not wear off after some time. Having a somewhat waterproof backpack and saving 1-2 kg on weight due to the lower weight of the Porter its quite worth the investment. I am going to patch the holes in my backpack and then it should be fine for another 1-2 years.
