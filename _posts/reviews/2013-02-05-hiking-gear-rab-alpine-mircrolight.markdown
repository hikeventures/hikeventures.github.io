If you are looking for a new down jacket which you can use during your hiking, backpacking or any other backcountry adventure mainly during spring and autumn  or as a mid-layer during winter then the Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket could be an option and here comes a short review. I was hiking with this jacket in -5 Â°C and felt comfortably warm just wearing a t-shirt under it. However, I started to feel cold at this temperature when I was not moving.

Since the jacket is filled with down it takes much less space in your backpack than a synthetic jacket. Alternatively, you may also have a look at the <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-montbell-u-dot-l-down-parka" target="_self">Montbell UL Down Parka</a> which is a bit lighter than the Rab Microlight Alpine jacket and which is my current down jacket.

## Features
The Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket weights 345 grams is filled with 140 grams of 750 cuin goose down.

## Recommendation
The Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket is a nice down jacket which is also quite affordable. If you look for a real winter down jacket then the Rab Positron Jacket might be an alternative (at least I would pick it as my winter down jacket). However, if you are looking for a jacket which you can wear in the evenings in the camp or as a midlayer during the winter then the Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket is a great choice.
