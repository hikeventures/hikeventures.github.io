Having tried some of the ready made food packages to take on my hikes, I got interested to read more about preparing dehydrated backpacking food myself at home. Backpack Gourmet offers plenty of easy to follow recipes - some of them also suitable for vegetarians - and each recipe also contains the weight and servings and how to prepare the meals in the dehydrator.

The book starts with tools needed to dehydrate and pack food at home and on how to prepare it on the field.

The receipes presented in this book range from breakfast meals, breads, drinks, crackers, toasts, spreads, jerky, dried fruit, bars, cookies, soups, stews and pasta.

At the end of the book is also a list of suggested reading from the author.

If you don't have a dehydrator at home then you can get a basic dehydrator at <a href="http://amzn.to/14ZAS3q" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>.
