The Salomon Speedcross 3 are my new lightweight hiking shoes for the warmer months, which I recently bought as they were on sale. Hiking and Backpacking lightweight can make your outdoor experience more enjoyable. This principle also applies to hiking shoes and here comes a short review about the Salomon Speedcross 3 related to hiking and backpacking.

The Speedcross 3 are 310 grams light and will replace my <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-inov-8-roclite-295/" target="_self">Inov-8 Roclite 295</a> which did a good job in the past.

There is also a GTX version of the Speedcross 3 available, however drying them once they get wet may take longer than for the non-GTX version.
I would most likely take other boots with me if I would plan to go hiking in a swampy area.

The Speedcross 3 also comes with OrthoLite sockliner which should help to keep the foot dry.
Moreover, I also found the Quicklaceâ„¢ quite interesting as there is no bumbling around with the laces anymore.

Looking at the sole of the Speedcross 3 it seems to me quite obvious that the shoe should have a very good grip which should perform great in muddy conditions. Personally, I wouldn't wear this shoe if I would go on a trip to <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/">Sarek National Park</a> since I had constantly wet feet with my old trail runners there but for shorter trips or for trips in more dry conditions the Speedcross 3 should be a good alternative to a normal hiking boot. The only issue I had with this shoe is that it might be very slippery on wet stone. Also when you are planning to carry a lot of gear then a more supportive or traditional hiking boots would make more sense.
