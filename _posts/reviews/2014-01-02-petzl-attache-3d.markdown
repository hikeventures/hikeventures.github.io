The Petzl Attache 3D is a new version of the Petzl Attache carabiner which is 31 percent lighter than the original. I will use this carabiner mainly to attach stuff to my backpack which I consider as quite handy especially after my last trip to <a href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">Sarek</a>.

Attaching <a href="http://amzn.to/X0WwPY" target="_self">hiking boots</a> on the <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hmg-porter-4400-black/" target="_self">backpack</a>. Quite handy if you go for example packrafting.

## Recommendation
I have not tried the carabiner for climbing so I am not able to say anything about it's climbing properties. It's a little bit expensive compared to other carabiners but I like the weight, look and that the gate barrel can be locked.
