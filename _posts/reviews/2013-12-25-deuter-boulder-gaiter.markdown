Winter time - Gaiter time! To keep snow out during my winter activities like winter hiking, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing I am using gaiters and here is a short review of the Deuter Boulder Gaiters which are are quite light and super durable.

## Function
The Deuter Boulder gaiters can be attached on shoes with a leather strap.

On the top you can tighten a cord to seal the pants with your gaiters.

The gaiters are attached on your shoelace with a hook.

There is also a slide fastener to close the gaiters.

## Recommendation
Of course there are lighter gaiter options available but I doubt that they are that durable. I am not planning to buy any new gaiters at any point in the future, thus durability has a higher priority for me. The Deuter Boulder gaiters seem to be a good choice to me for a good price.
