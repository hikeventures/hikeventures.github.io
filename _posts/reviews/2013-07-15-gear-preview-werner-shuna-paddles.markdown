Having purchased a <a hre="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-unpacking-alpacka-packraft/" target="_self">packraft</a> a while ago, I was looking for the best packrafting paddles which were in my budget and came accross the Werner Shuna paddles which come in 4 peaces and are super light to take with you on your packrafting trip.

## Wish list for my Packrafting Paddles
There are a few features which I was looking for with my paddles. They should be lightweight, not too expensive, durable, portable to carry around with my backpack and of course also look nice.

I did some research and learned  about the Werner Shuna paddles which should be one of the best paddles on the market.Unfortunately, they were not offered as a 4 pieces version on the Werner website when I bought them but it is possible to order custom made paddles which come in 4 pieces.

## Features
The Werner Shuna paddles are high quality carbon paddles with a great design and a weight of 780 grams. There are also several colors available.

The angle is adjustable as you can see on the left hand side of the paddle.

I really like the design of these paddles. They just look great and they are super light. If you have the money to buy a <a hre="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-unpacking-alpacka-packraft/" target="_self">packraft</a> then you should definitely not save on your paddles.

## Recommendation
We have tested the Werner Shuna paddles on <a href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">our trip to Sarek</a> in Sweden. They are light, performed very well and they look nice too. Highly recommended.

<strong>Update: </strong>I have used the Werner Shuna paddles now for over 1.5 years and I am still happy with them. They also helped me to get out when I got stuck between some rocks in the rapids and they didn't break. They just have a few scratches on the surface so far. I would say that they are worth the money I have spent!

You can get the Werner Shuna paddles on <a href="http://amzn.to/2uYaiWl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>.
