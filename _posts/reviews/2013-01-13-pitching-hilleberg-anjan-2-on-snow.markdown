The Hilleberg Anjan 2 is actually a lightweight (1.8 kg packed) 3 season tent. However, I believe that this tent could also be used during the winter season if there is only light snow fall and no strong winds. However, I have not tested it yet myself (to be on the safe side, I would rather take a 4-season tent with me). Here you can see how the Hilleberg Anjan looks like pitched on snow.

Have a look <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/" target="_self">here</a> if you want to see how the Anjan 2 looks during the summer months.

## Recommendation
If you are looking for a 4-season tent then the Hilleberg Nallo is probably the better choice.
