Last Sunday, <a href="http://caide.kuvat.fi">Caj</a> and his wife joined me for a trip in the Finnish Archipelago Sea around Ruisalo in Turku as they wanted to test their new Anfibio Packsuit which they ordered from the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Clothing/Anfibio-Packsuit::378.html">Packrafting Store</a> in Germany. Caj was already a bit in panic if he would receive his drysuite on time as he was planning to take it to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016</a> which will take place next weekend.

Caj decided to take his GoPro Hero Session camera to film our paddling adventure around the Turku islands. I have paddled already <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Paddling-the-Archipelago-Sea/">last year</a> quite a lot in the Turku Archipelago during the seasons.

The South-West Coast of Finland is one of my favourite outdoor spots in Finland. The sea, pine trees, seagulls, rocks and the wind give this whole place a certain magic (as Caj would probably describe it).

The sun sparkling over the Baltic Sea. Summer is definitely not far away anymore.

Caj wearing his tiny GoPro Hero Session camera on his helmet. His camera was set to take a picture every 0.5 seconds to make sure that he would not miss any shot.

When paddling around Ruisalo it's important to look out for big ships when paddling away from the shore.
      
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26703754931/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting in Turku"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26703754931_4007803554_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting in Turku with Anfibio Packsuit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
Sometimes it's a bit hard to estimate how long it would take for a ship to reach us. In this case we decided just to wait and let the ship pass before continuing paddling.

We took it quite easy on that day, saving our energy for the packrafting round-up next week. The advantage, plenty of possibilities to have a chat and talk about future outdoor plans.

After some paddling we decided to have a break in one of the islands and to explore it a little bit. There were plenty of birds on the island but they flew away once we came closer to the island.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26165741834/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting in Turku"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26165741834_d3e97b5b32_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting in Turku with Anfibio Packsuit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
The birds didn't really disappear but rather observing us from the distance.
    
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26677524712/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting in Turku"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26677524712_be7549e5b8_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting in Turku with Anfibio Packsuit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
Strolling a bit on the island we found some duck eggs. However, the smell was terrible. 
    
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26771171935/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting in Turku"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26771171935_1f755d5237_b.jpg" width="100%" alt="Packrafting in Turku with Anfibio Packsuit"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
On the way back we had to wait again for a ship to pass by.

Once we came closer to the shore we had plenty of fun watching Caj testing his new Anfibio Packsuit.

After paddling and drysuite testing we can probably say that we are ready for the Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016 next weekend.
