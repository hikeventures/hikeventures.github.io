Chris Townsend's book is quite extensive with over 400 pages and also won the Outdoor Writer's Guild Award for Excellence. The book goes quite into details and if you are interested in buying gear then this is the one you should look out for. The book comes with plenty of blackwhite photos and illustrations. It also has a listing of manufacturers and links to websites, maps and blogs at the end of the book.
