Today, I wanted to test the performance of my Sigma Merrill DP1 in night condition here in Vaasa. The pictures below are taken with ISO100 and are crops. I also used a tripod. There are also rumors in the Internet that the battery just lasts 7 shots or so in cold conditions. I took around 15 pictures and the battery was not empty at all. Temperature was about -3C. Maybe I was just lucky with my batteries :)
