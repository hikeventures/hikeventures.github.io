Looking for a warm high quality down sleeping bag for 4-season hiking, backpacking, camping or other outdoor activities? The Cumulus Panyam 450 sleeping bag has been our choice for our trips to northern Sweden in autumn. Cumulus manufactures their sleeping bags in Poland and I found the price / value ratio of their sleeping bags much better than of those other big outdoor brands.

There is a right and a left side zip option available. The pertex quantum shell also protects the down somewhat of moisture.

Further, it has an internal pocket and comes with a storage mesh and a stuff sack.

Pertex Quantum helps to protect the down from moisture.

The cord on the hood lets the sleeping bag snug around your face and keeps you warm.

The Cumulus Panyam 450 comes with a meshbag to store it at home.

The trapezoid chamber baffling system delivers a higher degree of warmth compared to other baffling systems. There is a full-length zipper on the sleeping bag which helps to ventilate if it is getting too warm in the Panyam 450. It's also quite easy to get the sleeping bag in the stuff sack which comes with the Panyam 450.

Moreover, the elastic hood and collar worked perfectly and kept me warm in my sleeping bag. As I was looking for a 3 season sleeping bag I was so far very happy with the Panyam 450 and would recommend it. Also there was no need to have a heavy synthetic sleeping bag if you just take care that the down does not get wet i.e. having a proper air ventilation in your tent or dry your sleeping bag in the sun while you rest e.g. while having breakfast in the morning. <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/packrafting-the-eman-river/">Here</a> is another trip where we were packrafting the Eman river in Sweden and took our Cumulus Panyam 450 with us.
