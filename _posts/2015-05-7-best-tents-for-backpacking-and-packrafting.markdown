For our packrafting kayaking trips we are currently using the [Hilleberg Anjan](http://www.hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/ "Hilleberg Anjan") which has served us quite well so far in [Sweden](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Packrafting in Sarek"), [the Netherlands](http://www.hikeventures.com/packrafting-in-the-weerribben-wieden-national-park/ "Packrafting in the Netherlands") and [Finland](http://www.hikeventures.com/halloween-adventure-at-lake-suolijarvi/ "Packrafting in Finland"). However, we are always looking for ways to get better gear and realised that a freestanding dome tent would be the ultimate tent solution for our packrafting and kayaking adventures as we also came across some areas where pitching a tunnel tent was quite difficult. The list below contains freestanding and non-freestanding tents which we are currently considering as the best solutions for kayaking and packrafting in 2015 / 2016.

So which is the best tent to choose? First, you should go through the points I have listed below in order to find out what kind of tent you really need:

## Tent footprint
Do you need a tent footprint? Well, I have never used a tent footprint and from my point of view your tent should last for a while if you clear the ground before you pitch it. I consider a tent footprint as unnecessary weight if you go hiking but it might be useful if you go on a trip by kayak where weight is not that important.

## Tent stakes & poles
Tents usually come with tent stakes. If you want to save a little bit of weight then you could also purchase separate carbon stakes and poles like the [MSR Carbon Core Stake Kit](http://amzn.to/1Q32GJG "MSR Carbon Core") which weights only 6 grams.

## Tunnel tent or dome tent?
Another consideration might be if you need a freestanding dome tent or a tunnel tent. A tunnel tent might be lighter but on the other hand you are able to pitch a freestanding dome tent also on places which are not suitable for tunnel tents e.g. when you go paddling and you want to camp on a (rocky) small island or on a sandy beach. There are also self-supporting tents which are more or less freestanding but still need 2 or more stakes. Currently, I am having a Hilleberg Anjan 3 - a tunnel tent - which I am quite happy with. But since we are also [paddling](http://www.hikeventures.com/sarek-packrafting-video/ "Packrafting Video")quite often I will most likely get another tent which is freestanding e.g. the Hilleberg Allak which I have also listed below. Since a dome tent can carry more snow load it's also perfectly suited for winter camping.

## Tent as a Tarp?
Do you want to leave your inner tent at home to save some weight and use the outer tent as a tarp?

## Mesh as an inner tent?
In the warmer months you would like to have a mesh as an inner tent either to have a better air circulation or to have a panorama view if there are no clouds in the sky. Not all tents have a mesh as an inner tent (e.g. Hilleberg) and you need to purchase them separately.

## Protected or unprotected areas
Are you hiking in a protected area like a forest or an unprotected area like on a hill or mountain which requires a stronger tent.

## Season
Do you plan to use your tent during 3 or 4 seasons (winter)? The fabric of the tent has an impact on the weight and the durability of the tent. Of course 4 season tents will have a stronger fabric but will also weight much more. Hilleberg for example gives an good overview of the [tear strength](http://www.hilleberg.com/home/tent_info/tearstrength.php "Tear Strength Hilleberg") of the fabrics they are using for their products.

## Vestibule
Do you need a vestibule to store gear or cook when it's raining?

## Size & Weight
Do you want to have a tent which packs small so it fits into your backpack when going hiking (an ultralight tent) or can the tent be bigger and heavier since you are transporting it with a kayak or packraft?

## Additional Features
I like the pockets on the wall of our Hilleberg Anjan tent which are just located at the right and left side of the entrance. I usually store small items in it such as a pocket knife, my watch or a headlamp. Also a clothes line which goes through the tent can be useful to dry clothes as you can see in the picture below. Reflectors may also help you to spot your tent during the night.

## Freestanding tents

### Hilleberg Allak
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X2JUM6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003X2JUM6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=MPFYT4UWH4JSFZEJ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B003X2JUM6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003X2JUM6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200   
**Weight:** 3.3 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.8 m²   

The Hilleberg Allak has the advantage that it has 2 entrances and it which makes it quite easy to get in and out of the tent if you are travelling with someone else. Another advantage of
having two entrances is that you are more flexible with the venting options. The disadvantage we see with this tent compared to the Jannu is that it weights slightly more and that it is also slightly more narrow than the Jannu (130 cm rather than 145 cm). The Allak is 5 cm taller than the Jannu and offers a better possibility to sit in it.

### Hilleberg Unna
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IU0UMSC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IU0UMSC&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=EAFEBCVMMSNCWMCD"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU0UMSC&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00IU0UMSC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Unna is a freestanding one person tent and offers 0.5 m2 more room than the Hilleberg Soulo. However, it does not have a dedicated vestibule but you can create a vestibule in the Unna by disconnecting a corner in the inner tent or take your gear inside (while leaving your backpack outside or storing it between the inner and outer tent). The large entrance can be used as an excellent "panorama window".

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200    
**Weight:** 2.2 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.5 m² 
 
### Hilleberg Soulo
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LAP3G6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LAP3G6&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=7TXJU4WYWUN5PLN3"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B004LAP3G6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004LAP3G6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200   
**Weight:** 2.4 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.0 m²  

The Hilleberg Soulo is a very strong solo expedition tent. If strenght is important to you and you need a dedicated vestibule then you should choose the Soulo rather than the Unna.

## Non-freestanding tents

### Hilleberg Enan

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UZ8ZPIE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UZ8ZPIE&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=J5D2VAGZEEOJ4END"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZ8ZPIE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UZ8ZPIE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Enan is a non-freestanding 1 person tent.

**Fabric:** Kerlon 600   
**Weight:** 1.1 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 1.7 m²  

If you are travelling alone on a shorter trip where you don't have lot's of gear with you then the Hilleberg Enan with 1100 grams could be a light choice during the warmer months. The only disadvantage we see with this tent is that it's not very roomy. It's also shorter then the Akto and you can only sit in one position in this tent. Venting should be quite good if you position one end of the tent with the mesh towards the wind.

### Hilleberg Niak 1.5

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT52A08/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01AT52A08&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=2TDIHYJWJ46ET5ID"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01AT52A08&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B01AT52A08" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Niak 1.5 is a non-freestanding 1-2 person tent.

**Fabric:** Kerlon 600   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²   

The Enan as a solo tent looks like an interesting tent for the summer months. However, if you need more space e.g. if there is a longer rain period then you would appreciate most likely the new Niak 1.5. It can accommodate 1-2 persons and has a vestibule to store your gear. I was actually interested in getting the Hilleberg Unna or the Akto as a go-to solo tent but I would prefer having the Niak 1.5 if I would just use it during the warmer months.

### Hilleberg Akto
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKHF7E8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TKHF7E8&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=VP7IBWWKQQ3PVKWT"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKHF7E8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00TKHF7E8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Hilleberg Akto is a non-freestanding 1-person tent for 4 seasons.

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200
**Weight:** 1.7 kg
**Area inner tent:** 2.6 m²

The Akto is a solo tent with low weight and quite popular among solo travellers. If you are not going into extreme conditions then this could be a great solo tent if you don't need a lot of space. For harsher conditions I would rather pick the Hilleberg Soulo or the Unna which comes with more space.

### Hubba Hubba NX
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G7H9CAY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00G7H9CAY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=EX4S5YFHURHMA3L5"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7H9CAY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00G7H9CAY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is a freestanding 2-person tent for 3 seasons.

**Fabric:** 20D ripstop / 30D ripstop (floor)   
**Weight:** 1.7 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.7 m²   

The MSR Hubba Hubba NX is a great 3 season tent and it even costs almost half the price of a Hilleberg tent. The Hilleberg just has a stronger floor material (50D) compared to the MSR but you get plenty of room. I think it's a tough decision to choose between the Niak 1.5 and the Hubba Hubba NX. If you are low on budget then we could higly recommend the Hubba Hubba NX as we have also used it on our trip in Sweden and Japan. Reviews soon available on our blog.

### Hilleberg Anjan 3
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JBUC8V4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00JBUC8V4&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=LOTRXVRJVO6XQYX4"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBUC8V4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00JBUC8V4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1000   
**Weight:** 1.9 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 3.4 m²   

If you are traveling with your friend then the Hilleberg Anjan 3 is our top choice during the warmer months. We would definitely choose the 3 person version of this tent since the 2 person version is just too small (own experience) for 2 people.

### Hilleberg Nallo
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMR6HSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMR6HSO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4YIQPTOP7VXOY4EM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMR6HSO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMR6HSO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Length:** 220 cm   
**Width:** 130 cm   
**Height:** 100 cm   
**Area inner tent:** 2.8 m²   
**Vestibule:** 1.3 m²  
**Weight:** 2400 grams   
**Fabric:**  Kerlon 1200  

The Hilleberg Nallo is probably the best choice if you want a 4-season tent which offers the most space and a vestibule for the least weight. If you don't need a freestanding tent and the best weight / space ratio 4-season tent then you should pick the Nallo.

### Hilleberg Nammatj 2
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NUP7ZIM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NUP7ZIM&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=LBLNHK4GLH5A46EQ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUP7ZIM&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00NUP7ZIM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1800   
**Weight:** 3.0 kg   
**Area inner tent:** 2.8 m²   

This is a bombproof tent. If you need more space then you should have a look at the Kaitum.

### Hilleberg Kaitum 2
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KGNR7CK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KGNR7CK&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=TZ2L7T5TXCG63VQI"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGNR7CK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00KGNR7CK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Fabric:** Kerlon 1200      
**Weight:** 3.1 kg    
**Area inner tent:** 3.0 m²  

Not as bombproof as the Nammatj, the Kaitum offers lots of space and can also be used during the winter months. If space is important for you and you don't mind the additional weight during the summer then the Kaitum 2 could be a good choice. If you take the Kaitum 3 then you just have to carry 300 grams more compared to the Kaitum 2 but you get 0.8 m2 more inner space.

## Conclusion
To conclude, it's quite hard to say which tent is the best tent. It all depends on your needs and where you are planning to use the tent. Currently, we are using the MSR Hubba Hubba NX and the Anjan 3 (see also [here](http://www.hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/ "Hilleberg Anjan Tent")) which works great during spring, summer and autumn. The only disadvantage with the Anjan 3 is that it is not freestanding.

I recently asked Hilleberg concerning their fabrics and they recommended to go for Kerlon 1200 or 1800 for exposed environment and long duration trips.

As I also want to use my tent in remote areas of Scandinavia where some parts do not even have cell phone coverage in case of an emergency (except if you have a GPS messenger) the Enan and the Niak 1.5 (3-season tents with Kerlon 600) are not going to be my go-to tents.

As a freestanding 2-person tent I would either pick the Allak as a 2-person tent or the MSR Hubba Hubba NX.

Personally, I would choose the Hilleberg Unna as a 1-person tent since I need a freestanding tent for packrafting and kayaking but on the same time it is light enough for backpacking. The Unna also offers lots of space and might be also more suitable for taller people. On the other hand we were also able to camp so far without a freestanding tent on all of our trips. In our opinion the MSR Hubba Hubba NX is enough tent for a good price for most of our trips we are doing (MSR provided us the Hubba Hubba NX for testing). Also the MSR Hubba Hubba NX offers 2 vestibules to store gear.

Also consider that if your tent is too small your sleeping bag gets wet if it touches the tent walls (and a small tent can get even smaller in strong winds). Some people said that venting could be an issue with the Unna but they replaced the standard inner tent with the Mesh inner tent sold my Hilleberg to convert it to probably best solo tent with great venting ability for the warmer months which can also handle strong winds.

However, if you want a 4-season tent with a plenty of space and a dedicated vestibule then the Nallo is probably the best choice (it's not freestanding).

The Soulo is the best 1-person tent for harsh weather conditions while the Unna is more versatile, bigger and a bit lighter than the Soulo. 

To sum it up. As a 1 or 2-person non-freestanding tent I would choose the MSR Hubba Hubba NX and as a 1-person freestanding tent the Hilleberg Unna with a seperate inner mesh tent provided by Hilleberg. As a winter tent I would probably choose the Kaitum, Nammatj, Nallo or Akto.
