Trekking and snowshoeing poles are especially useful if you have to walk up or down a hill or a mountain or if you have to walk in deep powder snow. You could also use those poles for Nordic Walking in your neighbourhood. I have compiled my own preference list below since I was interested to know which the best trekking and snowshoeing poles on the market are which I would consider to buy in 2016. The list below is sorted according to the weight of the poles and we have selected the poles according to our own preferences.

With [Tubbs snowshoes](http://hikeventures.com/tubbs-xpedition-snowshoes/ "Tubbs Snowshoes") and trekking poles in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/ "Finnish Lapland").

Currently, I am using the [Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles](http://www.hikeventures.com/gear-review-black-diamond-ultra-distance-z-pole/ "Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles") which are not made for snowshoeing as you can not add snow baskets on those trekking poles. However, I have also used them on our snowshoeing trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/ "Finnish Lapland") - Urho Kekkonen National Park - where I realised that snow baskets might be quite useful. For 3-season trips however they are great. You can see my trekking poles in action in our trip in [Swedish Lapland (Sarek National Park)](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Swedish Lapland").

The MSR Flight 3 is made of 7000-series Aluminium and has a non-absorbing foam grip and glove friendly straps. We have tested the MSR Flight 2 in the [Austrian Alps](http://www.hikeventures.com/Testing-MSR-Revo-Ascent-Light-Deploy-T2-Flight-2-Austrian-Alps/ "Austrian Alps"). They are great for summer and winter. If you look specifically for winter poles then you should have a look at the MSR Deploy T-2 or T-3 (below).

### MSR Deploy T-3

If you are looking for poles which you can also use during the summer then you should have a look at the MSR Flight 3.

Snow baskets are especially useful in deep powder snow when snowshoeing for example on our [trip in Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/ "Finnish Lapland").

## Features
When choosing your trekking or snowshoeing poles you should consider the following features:

* Do I want to use my poles only during the summer or also during the winter where I need to use snow baskets
* Do I want to have adjustable poles? They pack smaller but may not be that durable as the ones which can not be sticked together.
* Material of the handle - e.g. foam, cork, etc.
* Weight (lightweight or ultralight poles e.g. made of Carbon or Aluminium)

## Differences between trekking and snowshoeing poles
I would say the main difference between snowshoe and hiking poles is the possibility to add a snow basket to the poles. This winter when I went to Finnish Lapland I took my hiking poles with me which I wanted to use for snowshoeing and realised that there is no possibility to add snow baskets on them. For this reason I have separated the list below into two sections. One section is for poles which can be used only for hiking or trekking and the other section is for poles which can be used for hiking and snowshoeing.
