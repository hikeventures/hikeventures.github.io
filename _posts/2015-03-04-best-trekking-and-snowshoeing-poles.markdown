Trekking and snowshoeing poles are especially useful if you have to walk up or down a hill or a mountain or if you have to walk in deep powder snow. You could also use those poles for Nordic Walking in your neighbourhood. In this article you can find the best trekking and snowshoeing poles for 2016 which I would consider to buy. The poles are sorted by their weight and not by their performance.

Patrick snowshoeing in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/ "Finnish Lapland").

Currently, I am using the Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles which are not made for snowshoeing as it's not possible to add snow baskets on those trekking poles. However, I have also used them on our snowshoeing trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/ "Finnish Lapland") - Urho Kekkonen National Park - where I realised that snow baskets might be quite useful. For 3-season trips however they are great. You can see my trekking poles in action in our trip in [Swedish Lapland (Sarek National Park)](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Swedish Lapland"). Most recently, I have added a pair of dedicated snowshoe poles to my gear - the MSR Deploy TR-2 - which I have already tested in the [Austrian Alps](http://www.hikeventures.com/Testing-MSR-Revo-Ascent-Light-Deploy-T2-Flight-2-Austrian-Alps/).

## Features
When choosing your trekking or snowshoeing poles you should consider the following features:

* Do I want to use my poles only during the summer or also during the winter where I need to use snow baskets
* Do I want to have adjustable poles? They pack smaller but may not be that durable as the ones which can not be sticked together.
* Material of the handle - e.g. foam, cork, etc.
* Weight (lightweight or ultralight poles e.g. made of Carbon or Aluminium)

## Differences between trekking and snowshoeing poles
I would say that the main difference between snowshoe and hiking poles is the possibility to add a snow basket to the poles and to expand or shorten the poles while wearing gloves. My preference as the best trekking and snowhoeing pole goes towards the [MSR Flight 3](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-flight-3-trekking-pole).
