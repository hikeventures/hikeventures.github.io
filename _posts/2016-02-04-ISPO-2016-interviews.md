This year we have been to the ISPO in Munich to create a series of videos where we interviewed 23 outdoor brands about their latest product highlights for 2016. We have not done any video interviews in the past so this was an exciting opportunity to get more into videos and at the same time meet new people. Also new at the ISPO this year was that there was a dedicated blogger lounge where we were able to charge our phones and get a free voucher for snacks and drinks.
