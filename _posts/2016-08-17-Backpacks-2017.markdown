Are you looking for a new backpack in 2017 for your next hiking or backpacking adventures? Here is a selection of the best new backpack models for 2017. This is not a complete list but a selection of backpacks which I feel are worth to mention. When buying a backpack it's usually a good idea to buy a backpack for a specific purpose. For a multiday hiking trip you should get probably the largest size possible (depending on how much clothes and food you need).
