Recently, I received a new cooking set from Trangia which I am planning to use together with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2DkjImb" rel="nofollow">Bushcraft Essentials Bushbox LF Titanium</a> hobo stove (more about it below) but also on campsites with fireplaces or with a gas burner. We make a commission for purchases made through the following links which will help us to keep this blog running.

After doing some research on the Trangia website, I decided to opt for the Duossal 2.0 models since I was looking for a solution which is scratch resistant and can also handle high temperatures.
  
The Duossal 2.0 models are made outside of aluminium which provides and thermal conductivity and inside of stainless steel which makes them scratch resistant when cleaning them. Trangia advises using paper or moss for cleaning or heat up some water in the used saucepans/frying pans.  

I also like that they are not heavy since the thickness of the material is very thin -  a total of 0.8mm - consisting of 0.5mm aluminium and 0.3mm stainless steel.
  
## Trangia Kit
  
My Trangia kit includes the following items:
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2yRFutH" rel="nofollow">27-21 UL/D (120271) </a> which includes a windshield, inner and outer saucepans, frypan and a spirit burner. Weight 885 grams.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2CXeSKO" rel="nofollow">Cover (602707)</a>. Weight 25 grams.
* Pan grip (602510). Weight 48 grams.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2DhoPn6" rel="nofollow">Multi-disc (602709)</a> with Ø180 mm. Weight 74 grams.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2SJEYGi" rel="nofollow">0.6 litre kettle (200325)</a>. Weight 140 grams.
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2QeG4bx" rel="nofollow">2 x Plates (500020)</a>. Ø200 mm in aluminum. Weight 110 g.
  
I got the idea to cook on a hobo stove when visiting the OutDoor Show in Friedrichshafen, where we talked with Bushcraft Essentials about their outdoor stoves. Here is the video:

I found the hobo stoves quite interesting as they gives me the possibility to create a small fire if there is no fireplace nearby. They produce quite a lot of heat on a small spot. 

Of course, cooking on a hobo stove requires a bit of preparation e.g. I have to find wood and it takes a bit longer than cooking with gas. However, real fire just gives me a nicer atmosphere and also some heat to warm myself when it's cold. 

## Firestarter Kit
And here are some items which I use to start a fire:

* <a href="https://amzn.to/2qrNAV6">Gransförs Outdoor Axe</a>
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2PCtsOx" rel="nofollow">Moraknive Eldris</a>
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2DkfP0u" rel="nofollow">Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel 2.0</a>
* Tree bark e.g. from a birch tree
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2OkTNfn" rel="nofollow">Primus PowerLighter</a>
* <a href="https://amzn.to/2PEZRDS" rel="nofollow">Primus Filling Adaptor</a> for Lighter to recharge the lighter with a gas canister.

If you are not able to lit a fire with matches or with the Swedish FireSteel then the Primus PowerLighter is a safe option from my point of view. It can also be refilled with gas from your gas canister by using the Primus Filling Adaptor.
  
## Gas burner
  
Currently, I have only the spirit burner for my Trangia set but I am also planning to get a gas or multi-fuel burner in the future as I might also travel to places where I am not able to find fire wood or if I need to cook very fast.

## Preparing meals


In the past, I have always bought ready made meals from the camping store but I got tired of the taste and a trip is just much more fun if I have tasty food with me.
  
So, I decided to get a new <a href="https://amzn.to/2DnuU1s" rel="nofollow">dehydrator</a>, which I will use to prepare meals in advance before heading out for a trip. 
  
Once the food is dehydrated, I will store it in small minigrip bags. I am also thinking of getting a small <a href="https://amzn.to/2F0ZRKy" rel="nofollow">vacuum sealer</a> in the future which would keep the dehydrated food even longer fresh and dry than minigrip bags.
