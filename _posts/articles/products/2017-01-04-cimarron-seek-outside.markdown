Cold day, hot tent. Today we tested our new winter tent - Cimarron by Seek Outside. Is it the best winter camping tent? We are still testing it!

This hot tent is equipped with a portable wood burning stove, which makes it possible to enjoy even the coldest of winter nights.

Just make sure to have enough wood. [Here](https://seekoutside.com/cimarron) you can read more about the Seek Outside Cimarron tent.
