Recently, I was wondering if I should upgrade my manual Samyang 14mm f/2.8 lens to a newer lens which may also have wider optics and spotted the release of Irix 11mm f/4.0 which comes with an E-Mount and would be perfect for my Sony A7.

I am always interested to find the best lenses for my needs so I decided to make a short comparison about the differences of my favourite lenses which I would consider to buy for my camera.

Since lenses are in most cases quite expensive I always think twice before I buy a new one. However, I see lenses as a long term investment which I will also be able to use with camera bodies in the future.

I found the Irix 11mm f/4.0 quite interesting even so it comes only with f/4.0. The Irix would be a great lens for ultra-wide angle photography.

The company promises minimal distortion which may always be an issue with those ultra-wide angle lenses.

I also have the Zeiss Batis 25mm beside my manual Samyang 14mm and to be honest the Zeiss is my go-to lens every day. The picture below was taken with my Batis 25mm lens.

I only use my Samyang lens occasionally and would not really need the high aperture.

Of course it would have an advantage when taking pictures during the night but on the other hand I always have my Manfrotto BeFree Travel Tripod with me.

If you are interested in a wide angle lens with low aperture then the Sigma 14mm 1.8 ART lens is probably the way to go.

I was also eying with the Zeiss Batis 18mm for a while but then decided that a lower focal length than 18mm  would give me more benefits than a lower aperture.

The Sigma 14mm ART lens can actually offer much more than the Zeiss Batis 18mm in terms of aperture and focal length for my needs also considering the much lower price of the Sigma.
