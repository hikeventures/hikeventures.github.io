Recently, GoPro announced it's new GoPro Hero5 Black and it's GoPro Hero5 Session and I was wondering if there is actually a need to buy any of those GoPro cameras if you can also buy a more or less waterproof IPhone 7?

## Waterproofness
The GoPro cameras are waterproof down to 10 meters while the iPhone 7 can be submerged 1 meter for half an hour (IP67).

## 4K Video Quality
The iPhone 7 can record 4K at 30fps while the GoPro Hero5 cameras can record 30 frames per second.

## Picture Quality
The iPhone has a 12MP camera with an ƒ/1.8 aperture while the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/deals/#gopro+hero5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoPro Hero5 Black</a> has a 12MP camera and the <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/deals/#gopro+hero5+session" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoPro Hero5 Session</a> has a 10 MP camera with ƒ/2.8.

## Video stabilization
The GoPro5 Black, GoPro Session and the iPhone have image stabilization.

## Conclusion
Looking at the specifications you can certainly get better pictures with the iPhone 7. The video features are more or less the same and the higher aperture on the GoPro should not make a significant difference during daylight.

So which one should you buy? If you are more into hardcore adventures then the GoPro Hero5 Black or the GoPro Hero5 Session might still be the better choice especially if you are into diving or any water sports.

Having IP67 on the iPhone is nice but if you jump into a lake and the GoPro breaks for some reason then you are better off than with a broken iPhone 7.

Certainly, you might also get more scratches on your iPhone 7 screen. The surface of the iPhone screen is much larger than the surface of the camera lens of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ekq5Zy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoPro Hero 5 Black</a> / <a href="http://amzn.to/2el7Buj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GoPro Session</a>.

If audio recording is not important to you then you could also consider purchasing the older GoPro Session instead and save some money.
