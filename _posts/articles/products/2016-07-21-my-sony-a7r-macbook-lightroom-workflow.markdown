Today, I would like to present my planned workflow using the Sony a7III, Samsung T3, Lightroom and the MacBook Pro 2017. Whenever, I buy a new MacBook I also look on what accessories would be available to improve my photography workflow.

I bought my Sony a7 a few months ago as I wanted to have a full frame camera. The Sony a7 is a real bargain compared to the more expensive Sony a7RII. However, I am planning to get the Sony a7III once it will be released since I would like to record in 4K in the future and benefit of faster autofocus.

At the moment I don't need 4K, hundreds of AF tracking points and burst speed is also not important for me. So there is actually no reason for me to pay 2000 EUR more for a camera where I don't use all the functions.

My lens collection consists of the Samyang 14mm f2.8, Zeiss Batis 25mm f2 and currently I am saving for the Sony 70-200 f4. The Samyang is a real bargain compared to the other two lenses but you get a pretty good image quality with it.

Some people had some issues with the durability of the Samyang but for me it's just a play around lens. Usually, I have my Zeiss Batis 25mm on my Sony a7.

Previously, I also had the <a href="http://amzn.to/1widRB9" rel="nofollow">Sony 35mm F2.8 Sonnar T* FE ZA</a> but the Zeiss Batis is much nicer and with 25mm you have more creative possibilities from my point of view.

In my planned workflow (once the Macbook Pro 2017 has been released), I am going to connect my a7 (above mounted on a <a href="http://amzn.to/1vIdMYC" rel="nofollow">Slik Mini-Pro III</a> tripod) with my Macbook Pro with a USB cable to transfer the files from my <a href="http://amzn.to/2eaj3bq" rel="nofollow">32 GB SanDisk Extreme Pro UHS-II</a> SD card to my Macbook Pro (I prefer this way rather than pulling the SD card in and out).

The Sony a7 does not support UHS-II so you can also buy a <a href="http://amzn.to/2dFvf1Y" rel="nofollow">cheaper SD card</a>. However, there is a chance that I will buy a camera in the future which supports UHS-II and then I will be covered.

Next, I open Lightoom which I have configured to auto import images and videos from the a7 to my external <a href="http://amzn.to/2dFw5vv" rel="nofollow">Samsung T3</a> SSD hard drive which is connected with a USB-C cable to my Macbook Pro.

While importing files into Lightroom, I also create smart preview files for each picture which are saved together with my Lightroom catalog on my external <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5l0Cd" rel="nofollow">Samsung T3</a> which I dedicated exclusively to Lightroom. In general you only need to have the lightroom catalogue on a fast drive but having everything on one single SSD drive is probably the most convenient method.

After importing my files, I start sorting my pictures in Adobe Lightroom and delete those pictures where my manual focusing didn't work (since a couple of months I prefer doing manual rather than autofocus).

Then I add tags and import my GPS tacklog data from my <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5ms7L" rel="nofollow">Suunto Traverse</a> into Adobe Lightroom. Lightroom uses this data to apply reverse geocoding on my pictures, which means that it translates GPS data into a readable address.

Finally, I save the new metadata and Lightroom adds the data to an XMP sidecar file on each picture. During the export process in Lightroom I may also attach a watermark on my pictures which I then upload to flickr.

To be on the safe side, I also backup my data via Time Machine on a second hard drive like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eacWng" rel="nofollow">Synology DS216+II</a> or the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dgPsu7" rel="nofollow">WD My Cloud Pro</a> (those devices do not have USB-C so you need an <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5nLDl" rel="nofollow">adapter</a>).

If you are using Adobe Cloud then the <a href="http://amzn.to/2e5mRqy" rel="nofollow">
WD 2TB My Passport Wireless Pro</a> might be also a nice solution to stream your files wirelessly on all your devices.

As a monitor I am planning to connect my Macbook Pro 2016 to the new <a href="http://amzn.to/2dIi1S1" rel="nofollow">LG 27 4K IPS (27UD68P) monitor</a> which has a USB-C connection.

## Conclusion
There are several ways to transfer your files and work with them. The process described above is just my personal preference. You could also create a similar workflow with less expensive hard drives but the ones I mentioned in this article are currently my personal favorites even so they might be a bit expensive.
