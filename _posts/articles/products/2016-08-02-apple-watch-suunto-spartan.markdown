Apple and Suunto recently announced their new smartwatches - the Apple Watch Series 2 and the <a href="http://amzn.to/2edjBKs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suunto Spartan</a>. As I use my watch mainly for running and hiking I am interested in a watch which is water resistant and offer a long battery life. Both watches - the <a href="http://amzn.to/2edjBKs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suunto Spartan</a> and the Apple Watch 2 offer water resistant but the big question is still which performs better in battery life?

When Apple released the Apple Watch for the first time I decided to purchase a [Suunto Traverse](http://www.hikeventures.com/Suunto-Traverse-Ambit3-differences/) simply because it offered GPS and better battery life. The battery life of the Apple Watch might be ok if you plan to go running for 1 hour or so but if you go on a long hike with GPS switched on you don't want to start charging your watch every view hours. My [Suunto Traverse](http://www.hikeventures.com/Suunto-Traverse-Ambit3-differences/) could handle a full day of hiking with GPS switched on. As Apple did not mention anything about an improved battery life of the Apple Watch Series 2 we can probably expect a battery life of 18 hours with GPS switched off.

Apple has worked with Nike and developed the Apple Watch Nike+ which offers some additional features for runners. If you are just into running then the Apple Watch Nike+ sounds like a nice package as you don't need such a long battery life and it also comes with an built in heart-rate monitor on your wrist. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2edjBKs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suunto Spartan</a> still requires you to wear a heart-rate monitor around your chest.

# Conclusion

If you are into multisport or any activity which lasts several hours then I would probably get the <a href="http://amzn.to/2edjBKs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suunto Spartan</a>. If you only go running then the Apple Watch Nike+ is probably a better option. If you are an iPhone user then the Apple Watch Series 2 is obviously a better choice if you don't plan activities which lasts several hours. However, as I have not tested the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dt4Oyt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Series 2</a> I will need to see how long the watch might actually work with GPS switched on.
