Apple and Suunto recently announced their new smartwatches - the Apple Watch Series 2 and the Suunto Spartan HR.

As I wear my watch mainly for running and hiking, I am interested in a product which is water resistant and offers a long battery life.

Both watches - the Suunto Spartan HR and the Apple Watch 2 are water resistant, but the big question is still which performs better in battery life?

**Update 26.01.2017:** Garmin has released the Fenix 5X which I would currently buy as my favorite outdoor watch since it also offers the possibility to upload topo maps.

The Apple Watch 2 weights a bit more than the Suunto Spartan.

If you have already an iPhone and wear your watch for running shorter distances (maybe up to a half marathon), then the Apple Watch 2 is probably a better choice.

When Apple released the Apple Watch for the first time, I decided to purchase a  [Suunto Traverse](http://www.hikeventures.com/Suunto-Traverse-Ambit3-differences/) simply because it offered GPS and better battery life.

The battery life of the Apple Watch might be ok if you plan to go running for 1 hour or so but if you go on a long hike with GPS switched on you donâ€™t want to start charging your watch every view hours.

My  [Suunto Traverse](http://www.hikeventures.com/Suunto-Traverse-Ambit3-differences/) could handle a full day of hiking with GPS turned on.

As Apple did not mention anything about an improved battery life of the Apple Watch Series 2, we can probably expect a battery life of 18 hours with GPS switched off.

Apple has worked with Nike and developed the Apple Watch Nike+ which offers some additional features for runners.

If you are just into running, then the Apple Watch Nike+ sounds like an excellent package as you don't need such a long battery life and it also comes with a built in heart-rate monitor on your wrist.

The <a href="http://amzn.to/2pkGVh8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suunto Spartan HR</a> still requires you to wear a heart-rate monitor around your chest.

## Conclusion

If you are into multisport or any activity which lasts several hours then I would probably get the <a href="http://amzn.to/2pkGVh8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suunto Spartan HR</a>.

If you only go running then, the Apple Watch Nike+ is probably a better option.

If you are an iPhone user then the Apple Watch Series 2 is obviously a better choice if you don't plan activities which last several hours.

However, as I have not tested the <a href="http://amzn.to/2pKb4Gt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Series 2</a> I will need to see how long the watch might work with GPS switched on.
