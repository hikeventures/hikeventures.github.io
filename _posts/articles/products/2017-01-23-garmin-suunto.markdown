Currently, there are two interesting GPS watches on the market which I would find quite useful for hiking, backpacking or mountaineering - the Suunto Spartan Sport and the Garmin Fenix 5X. Both are currently the latest models from both manufacturers and their built in GPS feature, color display and battery life make them an attractive alternative compared to a smartphone with a GPS app - at least if you are frequently tracking your GPS or if you plan to go on remote backcountry trips.

In the past I have always used my Suunto Traverse to log my GPS data (see picture below on a trip in Finnish Lapland). However, there are certain features on the new watches which I found more appealing than on the Suunto Traverse - and in particular I would prefer to have the Garmin Fenix 5X over the Suunto Spartan. Why? Simply beacause both watches offer similar features with the Fenix 5X offering additionaly the possibility to upload 2GB of topo maps. Below I have summarized the main characteristics of both watches which were important to me.
