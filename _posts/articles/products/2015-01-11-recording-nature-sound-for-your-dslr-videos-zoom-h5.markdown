Having used my Sony A7 for over 1 year (but recently sold) I am planning to get better sound on my Videos once I get my new camera. The onboard microphone is more or less useless when filming in a windy place and in general you get better audio with an external microphone.

<a href="http://amzn.to/2dxQkfS" title="Zoom H5" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7468/15630751654_424fb06abb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="657" alt="best external audio recorder Zoom H5 sony a7"></a>

First of all it was important to know which type of microphone I would need. The <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs" rel="nofollow">Zoom H5</a> comes with an X/Y microphone which seems to be a good microphone to record the environment but also towards a certain direction. For a more focused recording (e.g. if you want to record a bird in the distance), a shotgun microphone would be even better and I might consider buying a <a href="http://amzn.to/14jumU0" rel="nofollow">Sennheiser MKE 600</a> in the future as well.

# Protecting your Zoom H5
It's always good to protect your electronic devices when you work outdoors. Zoom offers a protective case - the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eG64un" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zoom PCH-5</a> which comes with a fold-away clear window cover for making adjustments, removable mic element cover, belt loop, boom pole sleeve and keyring mounting options.

# Features Sennheiser MKE 600
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FX8V3SC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FX8V3SC&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=3aa4b145ca3f3324fd64485a61572ae2" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00FX8V3SC&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00FX8V3SC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

- Maximal rejection of side noise
- Switchable "Low Cut" filter
- Phantom or battery powering
- Battery switch with "Low Batt" indicator
- Rugged all-metal housing

The Sennheiser MKE 600 comes with a foam windshield and a shock mount. However I might also consider getting a Rycote 15cm Classic-Softie (19/22) for outdoor recording like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eFD5po" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sennheiser MZH 600</a>.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B8Z76X0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00B8Z76X0&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=17b78af7afe16f089958b85dbfab4df7" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00B8Z76X0&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00B8Z76X0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

# Cables
To connect the Sennheiser MKE 600 straight to your Sony A7 you would need a <a href="http://amzn.to/2ebT0gZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sennheiser KA 600</a> cable. If you want to connect your Sennheiser MKE 600 to your Zoom H5 then you should also get a <a href="http://amzn.to/2eG7o0g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">XLR cable</a>.

# USB Battery
On my trips I always have a USB battery with me like my <a href="http://amzn.to/2ebU6cw" rel="nofollow">Anker battery</a> which I charges my other devices having USB ports e.g. <a href="http://hikeventures.com/petzl-nao-headlamp-test/">Petzl Nao</a>, <a href="http://hikeventures.com/suunto-ambit3-ambit2-worth-upgrade/">Suunto Ambit3</a> or my DSLR. Therefore, the 2 AA batteries are not really needed and I can save some weight here. Also I will the the <a href="http://amzn.to/1y2BLVy" rel="nofollow">APH-5</a> extension pack for the <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs" rel="nofollow">Zoom H5</a> next week which comes with a wind shield and a remote control for the H5.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X5SP0HC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00X5SP0HC&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=06a061f895ef4a2c5f67299f8c1b07bc" rel="nofollow"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00X5SP0HC&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00X5SP0HC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I will most likely test the <a href="http://amzn.to/1yTJDZs" rel="nofollow">Zoom H5</a> on our trip to Lapland which we have planned by end of January. Let's see how it performs (also considering the cold temperatures there at the moment -30C) and I hope that I am able to provide great audio on our videos in the future.

# Improving Lightning
Obviously, with the equipment mentioned above you should get great audio quality for your videos. To improve your videos and pictures I would also recommend an additional LED light. I recently discovered that Manfrotto has a really nice and compact LED light - the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eG3GnK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manfrotto LUMIMUSE 8 LED Light</a> - which I am planning to use for indoor or night filming. It should also work quite well to take along on hiking trips since it is so compact.
