A few months ago Garmin has acquired DeLorme - the manufacturer of the inReach SE and inReach Explorer devices - and has recently released 2 new devices, the Garmin inReach Explorer+ and the inReach SE+.

Since I own myself a DeLorme inReach Explorer device I was quite excited to see what the new features of the new + models are.

OLATHE, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Garmin International Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), today announced the inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+, the first Garmin devices with inReach satellite communication technology, which was acquired through the purchase of DeLorme in early 2016. The new inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+ have Pole to Pole global Iridium® satellite coverage for two-way messaging and SOS alerting anywhere in the world. Both models include a built-in GPS for location tracking and basic navigation, and the inReach Explorer+ adds preloaded TOPO maps1, compass, barometric altimeter and accelerometer.

From backcountry treks to international adventures, these new inReach devices provide communication, location sharing, navigation and critical SOS functions for anyone who loves getting away from it all, no matter if it’s on land, water or in the sky, all while providing peace of mind for friends and family back home. The inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+ are being announced in conjunction with the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., and will be showcased at the Garmin booth #35811.

“Satellite communication is something our customers have been asking for, and we’re pleased to introduce the first Garmin inReach devices following our acquisition of DeLorme last year,” said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of worldwide sales. “Beneficial for both customers in the field and family at home, the inReach SE+ and Explorer+ provide peace of mind in addition to great functionality for people who want to explore anywhere and communicate everywhere.”

Using the worldwide coverage of the Iridium satellite network, the inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+ can send and receive text messages with any cell phone number, email address or another inReach device, so users can be outside of cellular range without compromising their loved ones’ peace of mind. Both devices have an interactive SOS, which triggers an emergency response from GEOS®, the 24/7 search and rescue monitoring center. After the SOS is received, inReach users are then able to communicate back and forth with GEOS about the nature of the emergency, and receive confirmation when help is on the way. Users can also set up emergency contacts on their devices that will also be notified in the event of an SOS.

Both the inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+ have a built-in high-sensitivity GPS that provides basic navigation, location and tracking data, so users can follow routes, drop waypoints and find their way back using an electronic bread crumb trail. The inReach Explorer+ adds more robust navigation options like preloaded DeLorme topographic maps, built-in digital compass, barometric altimeter and accelerometer. Similar to previous DeLorme devices, the inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+ are compatible with the web-based MapShare portal. With MapShare, the inReach device sends the user’s trip data, such as tracks and waypoint updates at preselected intervals, so friends and family can follow user’s whereabouts, request a location update and exchange messages.

With a compatible smartphone2, the inReach SE+ and Explorer+ can sync with the free Earthmate app for even more compatibility and convenience. With the Earthmate® app, users can access unlimited maps, aerial imagery, U.S. NOAA charts and USGS Quad Sheets. More data, like game management units and parcel information for hunters, is available for purchase. Users can also get optional weather updates and premium weather packages directly to the handheld and the Earthmate app. Additionally, every inReach device comes with free access to a cloud-powered portal so users can plan trips and waypoints, sync and manage their device, store all their tracking data and more.

On a single charge, the inReach SE+ and Explorer+ can get up to 100 hours of battery life in tracking mode and up to 30 days in power saving mode. Rugged and designed to withstand the elements, these devices are impact resistant and have an IPX7 water rating3.

To access the Iridium network and communicate with an inReach SE+ or Explorer+, an active satellite subscription is required. Depending on usage level, users can opt for an annual contract package or a flexible month-to-month airtime plan, which allows them to pay for service only when they need it. Annual plans range from $11.95 to $79.95 per month (plus activation fee), and month-to-month plans range from $14.95 to $99.95 per month.

The inReach SE+ and inReach Explorer+ will be available in the first quarter of 2017. The inReach SE+ will have a suggested retail price of $399.99, and the inReach Explorer+ will have a suggested retail price of $449.99.
