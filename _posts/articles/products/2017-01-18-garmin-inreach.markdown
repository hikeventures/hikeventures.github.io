A few months ago Garmin has acquired DeLorme - the manufacturer of the inReach SE and inReach Explorer devices - and has recently released 2 new devices, the Garmin inReach Explorer+ and the inReach SE+.

Since we own a DeLorme inReach Explorer device we were quite excited to see what the new features of the new Garmin inReach models are beside the external design of the device. We bought our inReach Explorer because we travel sometimes to places which are not covered by phone signals and it may take a few days to get out of a remote area to reach for help. Even so you have to pay for a monthly subscription fee I think it's just worth the money as safety is always our first priority when we heading into the backcountry.

Below you can see Konstantin while hiking in Japan. On the back of his backpack you can see the Delorme inReach Explorer (in it's yellow case) which has now been replaced with the new Garmin inReach Explorer+.

## Worth to upgrade?
If you are only using your device in emergency situations to send a SOS signal then I would probably not consider to ugrade to the new Garmin models. However, if you are looking for a device which you can also use as a GPS then I would probably upgrade to the new Garmin inReach Explorer+ since it comes with a topo map and has also space to store other maps as well.

You may also have a look at the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jxxCqo" rel="nofollow">Garmin Fenix 5X</a> if you need a device with map functionality. Garmin's new smartwatch does not have SOS features but it's capable to store maps and display them on your wrist while on the trail.
