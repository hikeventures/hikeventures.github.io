A few months ago Garmin has acquired DeLorme - the manufacturer of the inReach SE and inReach Explorer devices - and has recently released 2 new devices, the Garmin inReach Explorer+ and the inReach SE+.

Since we own a DeLorme inReach Explorer device we were quite excited to see what the new features of the new Garmin inReach models are beside the external design of the device. 

We bought our inReach Explorer because we travel sometimes to places which are not covered by phone signals and it may take a few days to get out of a remote area to reach for help. 

Even so you have to pay for a monthly subscription fee I think it's just worth the money as safety is always our first priority when we heading into the backcountry.

Below you can see Konstantin while hiking in Japan. On the back of his backpack you can see the Delorme inReach Explorer (in it's yellow case) which has now been replaced with the new Garmin inReach Explorer+.

## Worth to upgrade?
If you are only using your device in emergency situations to send a SOS signal then we would probably not consider to ugrade to the new Garmin models. However, if you are looking for a device which you can also use as a GPS then we would probably upgrade to the new Garmin inReach Explorer+ since it comes with a topo map and has also space to store other maps as well.


## Alternative without SOS features
If you are primarily looking for a navigation device then you may also have a look at the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jxxCqo" rel="nofollow">Garmin Fenix 5X</a> which features map functionality. Garmin's new smartwatch does not have SOS features like the inReach devices but it's capable to store topo maps and display them on your wrist while on the trail.

The previous model of the Garmin inReach SE is still a great device if you don't need the new map functionality of the Explorer+. Consider to get the inReach Explorer for additional features.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/2k3sk73" rel="nofollow">DeLorme inReach Explorer</a>

The inReach Explorer was the top of the line device from DeLorme. We have also carried it around on our trips. Again, if you don't need the topo maps on your device then this is probably the device to get as they might be cheaper than the new Garmin models.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/2iGDVUz" rel="nofollow">Garmin inReach SE+</a>

We are not sure what we should think about the new Garmin inReach SE+. It's probably a good choice if you don't need to load maps on your device and have not owned an older DeLorme model. However, we would rather pick the Garmin inReach Explorer+.

## <a href="http://amzn.to/2jY8030" rel="nofollow">Garmin inReach Explorer+</a>

The Garmin inReach Explorer+ is now the top of the line satellite messenger. It's ability to load topo maps makes it even more versatile. Since the device is water resistant it might be also a better choice to use outdoors than reading maps on a smartphone.

The Garmin Fenix 5X does not have SOS features but it might be a great watch to take with you on your trips and to read your topo maps.
