<ul>
<li>I can take my Packraft everywhere since it is very light</li>
<li>It inflates/deflates within a couple of minutes</li>
<li>It's great to paddle after work, relax and enjoy the scenery</li>
<li>I can combine it with hiking and attach my backpack on the front of the packraft if I am tired of walking</li>
<li>I can do whitewater paddling if I prefer more action (not tried yet however) :)</li>
<li>It's even more fun once you find people who own a packraft too</li>
<li>I can cross rivers and visit islands</li>
<li>Storage is free of charge</li>
<li>Material is very durable even so the packraft is quite light</li>
<li>Speed/weight ratio is great</li>
</ul>
