This year we have been to the Swedish Packrafting Round-Up organized by [The Deliverance Team](http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com). After the event, [Jacob](http://www.urbanpackrafter.com) decided to collect all our video footages to create a video. The result was "Inflatable People" - a video which won an award at the [Danish Adventure Film Festival](http://adventurefilmfest.dk/portfolio/inflatable-people/). More about the Swedish Packrafting Round-Up also on our [blog](http://www.hikeventures.com/Swedish-Packrafting-Round-Up-2016/).
