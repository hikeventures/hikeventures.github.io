Today, I had some time to try out my new <a href="https://amzn.to/2qZOvNb" rel="nofollow">dehydrator</a> and to prepare some tasty cinnamon apples. 

They are great as a snack and maybe more healthy than the chocolate cookies I eat from time to time which I buy in the local grocery store. 

Moreover, you can pack them into a Mini-grip bag and take them with you on a hiking trip.

Cinnamon apples are quite easy to prepare.

1. Wash and peal Apples
2. Remove the apple core
3. Slice the apples in thin pieces
4. Mix sugar and cinnamon on a plate
5. Coat the apples with the sugar-cinnamon mix
6. Put them into a dehydrator for about 10 hours at 60 C.
7. Eat them :)
