Most of my gear is equipped with an USB connection e.g. my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-suunto-ambit-2-black-hr/" target="_self">Suunto Ambit 2</a>, my phone, my camera or my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/petzl-nao-headlamp-test/" target="_blank">Petzl Nao headlamp</a>. But hey, I always run out of battery after 2 or 3 days and there is no USB connection in the forrest in order to charge my devices.

I found a solution which could extend the usage of your electronic gear for a couple of days.

## Features
The Anker Astro3E features high capacity for a low price. It also offers multiple sockets, weights 240 grams and has the size of a mobile phone.

It comes with plenty of connectors and you can even charge your iPad with it. With the battery you can charge 6 times your phone and you can even charge 2 devices at once (since it has 2 USB sockets with 3100 mA / h on each socket). There are also 4 blue lights on the front of the device which indicates the capacity of the battery. Charging of the battery via USB takes up to 8 hours on your PC and 15 hours on your laptop. The case which is included in the package seems to be useful too. It is mashed and feels quite soft - should protect the battery in case you drop it.

## Recommendation
I have tested the Anker Astro 3e battery on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/" target="_self">our trip to Sarek</a> in Sweden and we had enough juice to charge in addition my  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-suunto-ambit-2-black-hr/" target="_self">Suunto Ambit 2</a> and Sigma DP1 for 5 days.
