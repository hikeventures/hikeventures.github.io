Recently, I started with a new hobby - recording nature sound in stereo. Previously, I have always used my <a href="https://amzn.to/2zUrOin" rel="nofollow">Sennheiser MKE 600</a> to record nature sound but I got interested into stereo ambient sound recording. I don't have much experience in recording yet but after reading several blogs I learned that I can attach my Clippy Stereo EM172 like ears on a tree. The tree serves as a human head. In general, I was interested in a lightweight setup and that's why I think the Clippy Stereo EM172 are one of the best solutions for me.

Beside my microphones I also ordered Rycote windjammer. They are quite important to have when recording audio outside.

My recorder is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2PkoKBL" rel="nofollow">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a>. Personally, I found this the perfect audio recorder. It's small, solid and can be powered with normal batteries but also with a USB Power Bank such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/2zV5Xr2" rel="nofollow">Anker Power Core+</a>.

And here is the audio file which I have produced with this setup (wear a headset to listen).
