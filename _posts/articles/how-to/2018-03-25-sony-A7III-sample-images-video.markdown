Today, I was testing my new <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQG8ap" rel="nofollow">Sony A7III</a> and here are my first sample images which I have taken in Turku (Finland). Previously, I had the Sony A7 and the difference to the A7III is almost like day and night.

The autofocus is so much faster and the video features and quality have also much improved. It really motivates me to do even more with my new camera. I have not modified the picture which you see below. I have cropped some of them a bit to straighten them and minimised their size.

## Sony A7III Sample Video
And here is my <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQG8ap" rel="nofollow">Sony A7III</a> sample video in 4K with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2I1ujAM" rel="nofollow">Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2</a> lens. I have recorded the audio with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2uhWd9A" rel="nofollow">Sennheiser MKE 600</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQGuOh" rel="nofollow">Rycote Super-Softie</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2I5mKsZ" rel="nofollow">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a>.

The Sound Devices recorder was connected to the Sony A7III with a HDMI cable to take the time code from the MixPre-3. In Final Cut Pro it's then super easy to synchronise the audio and video files.

One more word to the wind jammer. I found the Rycote Super-Softie wind jammer the best solution. Well, there are better and more expensive options available but it performs better than a fur wind jammer and it's more durable.

So, would I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQG8ap">Sony A7III</a>? Definitely, especially if you are coming from the good old Sony A7 MK I.
