Today, I was testing my new <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQG8ap" rel="nofollow">Sony A7III</a> and here are my first sample images which I have taken in Turku (Finland). Previously, I had the Sony A7 and the difference to the A7III is almost like day and night.

The autofocus is so much faster and the video features and quality have also much improved. It really motivates me to do even more with my new camera. I have not modified the picture which you see below. I have cropped some of them a bit to straighten them and minimised their size with JPEGmini.

Here is my current Kit with the Rode Newsshooter Kit receiver on the top and the Sound Devices MixPre-3 on the bottom. More about it at the end of this blog post.

## Sony A7III Sample Video
And here is my <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQG8ap" rel="nofollow">Sony A7III</a> sample video in 4K with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2I1ujAM" rel="nofollow">Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/2DXfD3q" rel="nofollow">Sony 70-200 f/4</a> lenses. I have recorded the audio with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2uhWd9A" rel="nofollow">Sennheiser MKE 600</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQGuOh" rel="nofollow">Rycote Super-Softie</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2I5mKsZ" rel="nofollow">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a>.

The Sound Devices recorder is connected to the Sony A7III with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2pJnehw" rel="nofollow">Atomos HDMI cable</a> to take the time code from the MixPre-3. In Final Cut Pro it's then super easy to synchronise the audio and video files.

One more word to the wind jammer. I found the Rycote Super-Softie wind jammer the best solution. Well, there are better and more expensive options available but it performs better than a fur wind jammer and it's more durable. The headphone I am using is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2usU2jQ" rel="nofollow">Sennheiser HD-25</a>.

Finally, there is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2G9eXxA" rel="nofollow">Rode Newsshooter Kit</a> which allows me to connect my microphone wirelessly to my Sound Devices PreMix-3 audio recorder.

So, would I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2DQG8ap">Sony A7III</a>? Definitely, especially if you are coming from the good old Sony A7 MK I.
