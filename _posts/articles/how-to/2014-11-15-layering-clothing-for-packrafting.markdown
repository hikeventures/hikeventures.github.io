Layering your clothing properly is also important when going packrafting. In this blog post I am going to give you an overview over my clothing layering system mainly for spring and autumn.

And here is what you see on the picture above:

## Base Layer

### Icebreaker Men's Anatomica Briefs

The [Icebreaker Men's Anatomica briefs](http://bit.ly/14qhD2v) keeps me warm even if they get wet as they are made of Merino Wool. I highly recommend them. Usually, I take 2 of them on my adventures.<br><br>

## Insulation

### Devold Expedition

Devold Expedition [shirt](http://amzn.to/1uwNTKV) and [Long johns](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00BN5MSAQ) are made of 90% Merino wool and 10% Polyamid for longer durability and faster drying time.

### Fleece
You can use any regular fleece for example [Odlo](http://amzn.to/1zqR4Ep) or have a look on our post about the [best fleeces for 2015](http://hikeventures.com/best-fleece-jackets/).

### Smartwool Socks
Also made of Merino, the [Smartwool PhD Outdoor Ultralight Mini Sock](http://bit.ly/1hwvEPD) are light, dry considerably fast and keep me warm as well when wet.

## Shell

### Neoprene Dry Gloves

Currently, I am wearing neoprene dry gloves when it's very cold e.g. <a href="http://www.palmequipmenteurope.com/product/pro" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Palm Pro Gloves</a>.

### Latex Socks and Sandals
The <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Clothing/Latex-socks::380.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Latex Socks</a> work quite well for us. They are also sealing nicely if used together with a dry suite. Highly recommended. Use them together with the <a href="http://amzn.to/1q3n3KJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Teva Sandals</a>.

### Anfibio Packsuit
A dry suite is the most expensive item in our Clothing Layering System. The <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Clothing/Anfibio-Packsuit::378.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Anfibio Packsuit</a> is our dry suite. It's reasonably priced compared to other products and works quite well for us so far. You have to adjust the collar when you buy a new one so it snugs nicely around your throat.

It's also a good idea to have specific clothes for the summer like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dI0XrJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Icebreaker Cool-Lite Sphere T-Shirt</a> or the <a href="http://amzn.to/2f6c0AW" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Astral Designs V-Eight PFD</a>.
