In this blog post I would like to share how I created a Cinemagraph as in the example below out of a video footage from my <a href="https://amzn.to/2Shf9Ni" rel="nofollow">Sony A7III</a> with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2Afx28l" rel="nofollow">Sony 24mm f1.4</a> lens in Final Cut Pro. Personally, I really like this effect and it's really easy to do it yourself. There is also no need to buy any third party apps etc.

**Here are the steps to create a Cinemagraph in Final Cut Pro:**

1. Import the video footage into Final Cut Pro 
2. Drag the video footage into the timeline of FCP
3. Move the playhead to the point where the picture should freeze.
4. Click on "Edit" in the menu bar and then "Add Freeze Frame". 
5. Move the Freeze Frame in the timeline above the video footage and adjust the length to cover the whole video footage (or the part which you want to use for the Cinemagraph)
6. In the timeline select the Freeze Frame on top of the video footage.
7. Select Effects and then search for "Draw Mask".
8. Drag and drop it on top of the Freeze Frame in the timeline.
9. Connect points around the part which should be animated with the video footage.
10. In the Draw Mask settings make sure to select "Invert Mask".
11. Now adjust the video footage and the freeze frame according to your needs.
12. Add an audio footage. For example I always record my audio footage seperately with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2RbA33e" rel="nofollow">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a>.
