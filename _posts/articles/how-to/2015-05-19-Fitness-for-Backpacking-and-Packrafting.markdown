For every sport or activity where you move more than usual it's good to have regular exercise to keep your muscles trained. Having a good fitness and exercise regularly will help you to hike, backpack and packraft longer or more relaxed.

In order to keep myself in shape I run approximately 3-4 times a week and each run having a distance of approximately 9-15 km. That's about 1100 km every year. If you are not into running and would like to start with it then it's important to get proper running shoes to avoid injuries.

To find the right running shoes, you should first find out what type of running shoe you need. Your local sports shop might be able to meassure if you have a neutral, pronator or supinator foot type. In my case I have a neutral foot type. Moreover, if you run as often as I do (since 20 years) you should also invest every year into new running shoes. Idealy, you should have 2 pairs of shoes which you exchange regularly.

I found running quite relaxing. Usually, I don't run with full speed. Sometimes I do intervals, where I run 10-20 seconds with full speed. But in general I take it quite easy and enjoy the nature on the island where I am living while running.

Running keeps my legs in shape. However, it's also important to train other muscles and that's why I complement my running with a series of pull-ups.

It's also a good idea to have a GPS watch with you so you can meassure your distance or plan in advance your running route. You can also use a HR monitor to meassure your heart beat. I also use my Ambit3 also for hiking and packrafting and save all my data on our <a href="http://www.movescount.com/members/HikeVentures">movescount profile</a>. Below you can see the distance I was running yesterday.
