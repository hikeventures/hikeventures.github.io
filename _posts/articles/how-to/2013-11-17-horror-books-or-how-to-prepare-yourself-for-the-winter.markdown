Recently there have been a lot of speculations about the coming winter. Some scientists believe that this year we will have - what some Dutch media has already christened - the "horror winter" with low temperatures and lot of snow, which, according to the forecasts, will make it the most severe winter in the last 100 years.

I am not sure if that is going to be true (I am not a scientist and in general, the  "weather science" is notoriously inaccurate with their long-term predictions), but if it is, it will mean a lot of nuisance for most people, while for some it might spell a real disaster.

There is, however, a group of people who will definitely enjoy the cold and the snow. These are the outdoor enthusiasts, who, like me, have been looking forward to going cross country skiing, trying to dig a snow cave or, finally, using their snowshoes that they bought a few years ago and never had a chance to try (the disadvantages of living in the moderate climate). Some of them even travel half way across Europe, to the places that "always have snow" in winter, just to be tricked again  (for more information on that please see my forthcoming trip report on the last year&#39;s visit to the Table Mountains National park in the South of Poland).

That is why, if this winter IS going to turn out to be what they think it might be, I believe it will be wise for us to prepare for the snow and try to enjoy it to the fullest. As my contribution, I would like to review a few books that can help to change the minds of those of us who are still doubting if snow is good for them.

These books are:

* <a href="http://hikeventures.com/amc-guide-to-winter-hiking-and-camping-everything-you-need-to-plan-your-next-cold-weather-adventure-by-yemaya-mauer-and-lucas-st-clair/" target="_self">AMC Guide to Winter Hiking & Camping: Everything you need to plan your next cold-weather adventure by Yemaya Maurer and Lucas St. Clair
* Snowshoeing: From novice to master (5th ed.) by Gene Prater
* Free-heel skiing: Telemark and parallel techniques for all conditions (2nd ed.) by Paul Parker
* The complete guide to cross-country ski preparation by Nat Brown
* Ice & mixed climbing: Modern technique by Will Gadd
* Ice world: Techniques and experiences of modern ice climbing by Jeff Lowe
* The avalanche handbook by David McClung and Peter Schaerer
* The ABCs of avalanche safety (3rd ed.) by Sue A. Ferguson and Edward R. LaChapelle

The books are given in the order I am planning to review them. I will also try to write one or two reviews per week so that you are completely prepared before the Christmas holidays, and in case you find yourself surrounded by snow, you will only welcome this and full-heartedly sing "Let it snow, let it snow let it snow ..."
