Last year we have been visiting Scotland and paddled a few days with our packrafts on the River Dee. [Here](http://www.hikeventures.com/Packrafting-River-Dee-Scotland-1/) you can also find our trip report. The water level was occasionally quite low but we still had plenty of fun and enjoyed the landscape of the Scottish Highlands.
