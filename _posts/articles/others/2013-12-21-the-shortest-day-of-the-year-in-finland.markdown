Vaskiluoto harbour between Vaasa and Sundom. I took this picture on the way to my final destination - &#214;jberget - the highest elevation in the area.<br><br>

Ice Fishing Season has started again even so there is not much snow yet in Vaasa and temperatures are not that low. Today we just had 0 C. The shortest day of the year in Finland is really short compared to the Alps where I originally come from.
