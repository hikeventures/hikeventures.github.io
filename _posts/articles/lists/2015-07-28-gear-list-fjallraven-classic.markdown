Next monday I am leaving from Finland to Sweden where I am going to meet Konstantin for a 2 weeks trip in the Swedish Mountains as we are going to participate in Fjällräven Classic - a 110 km hike. Before and after the Fjällräven Classic we are planning to go packrafting as well. Here is my gear list for Fjällräven Classic and our packrafting activities.
