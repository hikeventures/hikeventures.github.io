This year we are planning again (<a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/ispo-2015-review/">ISPO 2015</a>) to visit the ISPO 2016 in Munich to find new gear for our outdoor adventures and to have interesting chats with the big outdoor brands. However, this year we are planning to meet other outdoor bloggers at the ISPO as well to exchange blogging ideas, tips and tricks and maybe also plan an outdoor trip together.<br><br>

Actually, one of the reasons why we blog is to connect with other likeminded people. On our trip in Japan we have e.g. met packrafters which we got to know beforehand via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hikeventure/">Instagram</a>. <a href="http://urbanpackrafter.com/">Urbanpackrafter</a> has also quite nicely documented our last meeting in Sweden in one of his great videos:

<br>
In 2016 we will probably have a similar meeting again during spring in Sweden. Then we might also be around in Scotland for a packrafting trip from end of February / beginning of March and of course there will be another <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Second-Finnish-Packrafting-Gathering-Finland-Helvetinjarvi/">packrafting meeting</a> in Finland which is traditionally organized by <a href="http://korpijaakko.com/">Jaakko</a>.
<br><br>
So feel free to <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/about/">contact us</a> if you want to meet us at the ISPO 2016 in Munich or if you are interested in exchanging blogging ideas or are up for an outdoor trip somewhere in Europe with us.
