In this post I would like to give an overview about the best camera bags for your Sony A7, A7II A7RII or A7SII (and also a6500, a6300 or a6000 since they share a similar form factor) which you can use for hiking, backpacking, canoeing or packrafting. As I have recently upgraded my own camera gear which I am planning to take to [our trips](http://www.hikeventures.com/destinations/),  I was in need of a new camera case which I can use for my outdoor adventures. I was looking for a camera bag or case which packs small and actually came to the conclusion that I would need different camera bags for my MILC for different activities.

# Best camera bags for hiking and backpacking

When I plan to go hiking or backpacking I would like to have a camera bag where I can easily access my camera. My camera bag should also be water resistant or waterproof if I don't have space to carry my camera in my backpack in case the weather turns bad. Here are the camera bags and cases which I would consider for my next hiking or backpacking trip.

For packrafting and kayaking I would like to have a camera bag which is completely waterproof. I would probably go for one of the following camera cases for my next packrafting and kayaking trip.

# Conclusion
From my point of view there is no best camera bag which fits every situation but having the right camera gear for different activities is essential to protect your gear and also to enjoy photography with your Sony A7 or a6300 more. I hope you are able to find your camera bag for your next hiking, backpacking, kayaking or packrafting adventure.
