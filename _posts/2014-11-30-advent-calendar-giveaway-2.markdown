I am quite sure that many of you would like to have a proper water filter under the christmas tree which you can use in your adventures in 2015. Well, now you can win one on HikeVentures! <br><br>

The [Katadyn](http://www.katadyn.com) Hiker Pro Microfilter is our next giveaway in our advent calendar. This filter is the most sold microfilter in the US and I myself use a [Katadyn Mini Microfilter](http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-katadyn-mini-water-filter/) on my own adventures.

<strong>Specifications:</strong>

* weight: 310 grams
* eliminates bacteria, cysts, and sediments from water
* 0.2 micron glassfiber filter cartridge
* active carbon filling improves the taste of water and eliminates odors
