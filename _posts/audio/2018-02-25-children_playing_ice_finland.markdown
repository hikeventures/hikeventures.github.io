Today, I was trying for the first time to capture audio with my Sennheiser MKE600, Sound Devices MixPre-3 and Rycote Super Softie. I selected Ruisalo - a popular beach at the Baltic Sea in Turku as a location.

The sea was frozen and children were playing with their sleds on it and throwing ice plates around. You might hear some wind as a background noise so I am not sure if my Rycote Super Softie windjammer was actually sufficient for this job.
