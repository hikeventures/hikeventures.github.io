Today, I was trying for the first time to capture audio with my <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://amzn.to/2F5Bc6n">Sennheiser MKE 600</a>, <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://amzn.to/2EPGbsl">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a> and <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://amzn.to/2HMI2Mm">Rycote Super Softie</a>. I selected Ruisalo - a popular beach at the Baltic Sea in Turku as a location.

The sea was frozen and children were playing with their sleds on it and throwing ice plates around. You might hear some wind as a background noise so I am not sure if my Rycote Super Softie windjammer did a good job.
