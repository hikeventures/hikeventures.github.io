Today we had a great sunny day in South-Western Finland with temperatures around -4C so I decided to drive with Caj and Katja outside of Turku to hike to the HÃ¶nkasaaren Laavu.

One of the typical markings in Finland when you go hiking.

Once we arrived at the Laavu we prepared some firewood.

Katja had prepared a nice cabbage soup and once we arrived at the Laavu.

Caj had one of his new "historical" axes with him and it was like a breeze to get our fire wood into small pieces.

The Laavu was well maintained. We had isolation pads with us so we could have sit there for hours without getting cold.

I had my [audio gear](http://www.hikeventures.com/mixpre-3-sennheiser-mke-600-rycote-super-softie-strut-STR-MP3/) with me and recorded us where we are talking about outdoor stuff and preparing fire wood.
