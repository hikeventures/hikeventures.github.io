The next days you are going to read about a trip to the Aland Islands and about a review of hiking pants on our blog which we have already promised a while ago. We have also invested in new action camera gear which we are going to use on our trips this year. On <a href="https://instagram.com/hikeventure/">Instagram</a> we have reached 1000 followers and we would like to thank everyone who is following our HikeVentures.
