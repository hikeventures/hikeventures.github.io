Patrick is preparing some gear for our winter trip in Norway while Konstantin is already enjoying his winter trip in Poland.
We will meet next Friday in Alta (Norway) where we will spend the first night in the Scandic Alta Hotel since Konstantin will arrive very late.
The next day we are planning to buy some stuff (like gas etc) from a local outdoor store and then we are good to go. Ready for takeoff :)

So what else happened? Willem posted a great article about the [Packrafting trip planning in wilderness areas](https://willemvandoorne.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/article-packrafting-planning-in-wilderness-areas/) while Jacob reported that the [River Voxnan local canoe center](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1224397364279952&id=308188359234195) has also watched his award winning video [Inflatable people](https://vimeo.com/181259608).
