Konstantin has done some Wadlopen in the Netherlands while Patrick was test driving his Packraft with his new [WindPaddle Sail](http://hikeventures.com/windpaddle-sails-for-packrafting/) in the Turku Archipelago. The confirmed date for the [Finnish Packraft Gathering](http://korpijaakko.com/2014/08/27/the-first-finnish-packrafting-gathering/) seems to be now from 3.10. - 5.10.2014.
