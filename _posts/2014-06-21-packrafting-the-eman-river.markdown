One week ago we went on Packrafting on the Emån River. We started our trip in Högsby and paddled all the way down to Påskallavik, spending one night in Fliseryd in our <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/" target="_self">Hilleberg tent</a>.

In Högsby we inflated our Packrafts. Unfortunately, it was raining the whole morning but once we were in the Packraft it was fine.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14466441174/" ><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5476/14466441174_82e06de31d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packrafting Eman River Sweden alpacka raft werner shuna paddle hmg porter 4400"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14280987939/" ><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3879/14280987939_d5d8351566_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packrafting Eman River Sweden alpacka raft werner shuna paddle petzl meteor helmet" ></a>

Finally, in the afternoon we also got some sun which lifted our spirit.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14488238923/" ><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5496/14488238923_ef6b1fc350_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" ></a>
Also the scenery changed from occasionally which made paddling even more interesting.

In Fliseryd we had to step out of the boat since there was a dam. We decided to walk a couple of kilometers and pitched our <a href="http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-hilleberg-anjan-for-the-summer/" target="_self">Hilleberg tent</a> in a forrest.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14445082066/" ><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2907/14445082066_ce53d89f1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Boilerwerks Backcountry Boiler"></a>
Our breakfast - Snickers and tea prepared with our backcountry boiler

The next morning we continued our hike and passed by the official camping place <a href="http://www.husvagnochcamping.se/campingkatalogen/SP150" target="_blank">Jungnerholmarna Fliseryd</a> for caravans. It seems that there has been a production of batteries in the past and the whole area had been cleaned of toxic materials.

We decided to continue our hike for a while as we were paddling the whole previous day

Searching for a way back to the river.

Once we found a way back to the river we inflated our packrafts again.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14467040614/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14467040614_52df62358c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear 4400 Småland Sweden Emån river packrafting rapids"></a>

The second part of our trip was more demanding and there were more rapids than on the day before.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14281572379/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5510/14281572379_7ff1345bae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Emån river relaxing nature"></a>

However, there were also spots where we could just relax (and paddle).

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14281622018/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14281622018_9544a481a1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683"></a>

Nice scenery...but behind those bushes was a deadly trap waiting for us...black flies! We decided to leave the packrafts only if really necessary.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14488357933/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14488357933_8b6046fa05_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683"></a>

At one spot the river splited into two and we decided to take the river which is was more narrow. However, a tree lay on one rapid where Patrick fell off his packraft and we were looking for an opportunity to have a break and to dry our stuff.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14281765687/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/14281765687_eff6516d5a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpacka raft swimming emån river packrafting paddling"></a>

Konstantin exercised a little bit with his packraft in case he would fell off his boat as well.

After our break we enjoyed more rapids.

We finally got out of the river in Påskallavik where we got immediately attacked by black flies again.

After we deflated our packrafts we decided to walk to the city center and to stay the night at the coast.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14464879951/" title="Påskallavik Harbour"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14464879951_43be6dde32_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Påskallavik Harbour"></a>

Even so we slept under the open sky we were able to sleep well until 9 am.

In general, the route seems to be manageable also for "experienced beginners" if you know where to step out and skip the risky parts (especially where the dams are or if you see obstacles like a fallen tree on a rapid). If you have only time for 1 day we would definitely recommend the part between Fliseryd and Påskallavik.
