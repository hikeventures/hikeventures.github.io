Faster, stronger, higher: high mountaineering is changing,
and the same is true for Julbo’s flagship model. More
ergonomic, better ventilation, slimmer and more stylish,

With large coverage, removable shields, 360° adjustable
temples and high protection lenses, these glacier
sunglasses are designed for extreme conditions without

## Julbo Tamang

Designed for novice climbers or hikers, with this wraparound,
robust model you can tackle the highest mountains with
complete protection, without worrying about glare. With
their integrated side-shields, polypropylene construction
and superior comfort, these glacier sunglasses will also
