When you plan you next hiking, backpacking, packrafting or other outdoor trip it's a good idea to have a pillow with you which is lightweight and packable. Here is a short review about the Exped Air Pillow UL M which is the perfect companion for the <a href="http://hikeventures.com/exped-synmat-ul-7/" target="_self">Exped SynMat UL 7</a> which we have used the last months on our adventures.

The Exped Air Pillow UL M weights comes with the size 38 × 27 × 11 cm. If weight is an issue then you could also use your fleece or other clothes as a pillow, however with around 57 grams you will not substantially increase the weight of your backpack in order to increase your sleeping comfort.

Quality and durability of the Air Pillow is also quite good and I am so far not able to spot any signs of wear on the Air Pillow which comes with a warranty of 2 years.

## Recommendation
I like the Exped Air Pillow UL. The pillow feels comfortable, packs small and seems to be durable. I would most probably buy it again.
