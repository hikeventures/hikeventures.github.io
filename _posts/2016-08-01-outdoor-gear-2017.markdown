For 2017 we can expect to see plenty of new tents on the market. The trend goes clearly towards lightweight tents. But are lightweight tents always the best option? It depends. Ultralight gear is sometimes made of materials which are not very durable. For example chances are high that you get a hole in your tent floor if the tent floor fabric is very thin. However, if you plan to go only ocassionally on outdoor trips or you plan a trip where you must carry less weight then buying a superlight tent might be a better option even so you may compromise with the durability of the tent. Anyway, enough bla bla... here are the latest super duper backpacking tents (and also some accessories) for 2017.

So which tent should you choose? It's definitely a hard question as there are many high quality tents out there. Do you need a winter tent or a 3-season tent? Idealy, you should buy a dedicated tent for different seasons or purposes to get your best tent for 2017. For example on our [hiking and packrafting tour in Norway](http://www.hikeventures.com/finland-norway/) I have only used a lightweight 3-season tent. I was not that happy with the durability of the inner mesh tent but on the other hand I did not have to carry that much weight.
