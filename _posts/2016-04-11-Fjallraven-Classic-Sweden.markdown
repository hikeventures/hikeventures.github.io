Start of the race. This picture was taken last year at the very beginning of the Fjällräven Classic Race. I was the sixth one on the trail (including two runners) and I managed to keep this position virtually until the very end of the 110 km race. And unlike the people in front of me, I was carrying a way more.

Fastpacking | Originally I was planning to hike the whole distance of 110 km in 4-5 days. But things do not always go as planned and instead I did it in under 54 hours.

I only realised how fast i was going only after we started to meet some people who started in the previous group several hours before us.


Hiking towards the top of Sweden | Even though the track is relatively easy, the views around you can be breathtaking.
