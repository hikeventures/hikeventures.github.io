Last weekend we visited the ITB in Berlin to get ideas for new adventures, to interview destinations and to participate in the ITB Blogger Speed Dating. We especially liked that you could experience the culture of some destinations right away at the exhibition. For example we really enjoyed the ceremony of preparation and drinking Kava when we visited the booth of the South Pacific Islands.

## ITB Speed Dating

The ITB Blogger Speed Dating is an event where bloggers and exhibitors have 8 minutes time to introduce and get to know each other.

At the blogger speed dating registration desk we received a list with all the appointments we had during the event. Each event on our list had a table number included.

The speed dating area was filled with small tables where the speed dating took place. Moreover, we were also provided with snacks and drinks which were free of charge.

Unfortunately, we were a bit late on our first date but still managed to introduce ourselves within a few minutes.

There was also an ITB photographer who took pictures of us while dating and we had to sign a form that we would agree that our pictures can be used and published.

Each session ended with an announcement that it's time to change to the next table.

However, since the number of dates were limited we were not able to meet every destination we were interested to meet. That's why we decided to meet some more destinations on their own booth before and after the speed dating event.

In general, we found the speed dating event a really good idea. Just make sure to set up appointments right away when the matchmaking tool is available as there are only limited amount of appointments available and they might be pretty fast booked.
