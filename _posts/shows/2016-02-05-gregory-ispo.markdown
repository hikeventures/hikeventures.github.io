Konstantin: Hi, this is Konstantin, and this is Andrea from Gregory. Andrea, what are the three highlights for this coming season?

Andrea:	The highlights we are introducing new is a hiking pack. It's a Zulu pack which we offer in 28 to 60 liters.

It's a ventilated pack which is very technical, very much lightweight.

It's a great suspension system and ventilation. We have it for men's and for women's three colors each.

Next to this we have a smaller hiking pack. It's ventilated as well. It's only slightly ventilated, offers a great fit, and you do not lose any space with those backpacks. Those backpacks are available from 18, 24, 28 liter. Again, men and women, three colors each.

We are certainly very proud to introduce a new snow line of winter products. We have it in three sizes, 26, 32, and 45 liters. Those packs are made for winter and can carry skis but also snowboards, snowshoes. It's really a full featured backpack in the bright yellow which is safety equipment, pure black, and a very trendy blue with red.

A nice feature here is again it's a suspension system which fits very close to your body. It's snow repellent, and the opening is from the back. We only use nylon material, which really offers a great quality and will last forever. You have helmet carrier with all three models. Ski system, also diagonal ski system, and next to this you have the possibility which you can see here for snowshoes and for ski gear.

Konstantin: I really like the feature that you can zip and unzip and put the helmet in and out and then you don't even need to carry it around and it's not visible.

Andrea:	It's very handy. You can just put inside the pocket here.

Konstantin:	And we are all set. Thank you, Andrea.

Andrea:	More than welcome.
