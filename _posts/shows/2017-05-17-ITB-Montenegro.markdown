**I am here with Thomas. Thomas represents Montenegro National Parks. Thomas, can you tell us what would be the interesting things to do in Montenegro?**

Especially the National Parks?

**Especially the National Parks.**

Yeah. We have five national parks in Montenegro, which is really exceptional in Europe, because Montenegro is a relatively small country and five national parks cover 8% of Montenegro and there is a lot to do.

Of course the traditional things you know from other national parks like hiking, biking, mountain biking especially (because we have lots of mountains in Montenegro; more or less, it is one big mountain, besides the cost.

Hiking is very popular on many trains we have. We have some thousand kilometres of hiking trails all over Montenegro, but especially in the national parks, of course.

But besides these traditional outdoor activities, we have very specific things more adrenaline… uhm.

**Inducing…**

Yes, activities like bungee jumping, big zip lines, adventure parks, and, of course, what is really big in Montenegro is rafting.

**You mentioned that you have one of the deepest canyons in the world.**

Yes, we have Tara canyon in the Durmitor National Park, which is the second deepest canyon in the world – 1.400 meters.

Extremely interesting, not only for rafting, but for hiking and biking as well. But the rafting experience of course is very specific, because you do not have conditions like this in another place in Europe.

You have three-days rafting adventure. It is 85 kilometres and there is no second place in Europe you can find something like this.

And since water level is different during the year, you have … well… sort of experiences. If you come there in late spring, it will be very different experience to August, for example.

**Well, thank you very much Thomas.**

Pleasure.
