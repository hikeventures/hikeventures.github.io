**Hi, this is Konstantin and I’ve got Rakhat from Kyrgyzstan**

Yes.

**Rakhat, could you give a couple of highlights of Kyrgistan as an adventure destination?**

Yes, actually we position our country as an adventure destination, because we have a lot of possibilities for lovers of hiking, trekking and that proves that our country…

90% of our country is covered by the mountains, which is, like, great place for, you know, those who look for adventure.

**For the outdoor lovers**

Outdoor lovers. Right.

**And what kind of activities would you recommend?**

In summer time, of course, for sure, we would recommend hiking, tracking, alpinism … a lot of possibilities, jeep tours, cycling, kayaking because we have a lot of mountain rivers.

And for winter time is, the country is, everywhere you can just freeride.

We have a lot of ski bases and the ski base, which is located in my town, is considered to be the best ski area in Central Asia.
