# Four reasons why we don't visit the OutDoors in Friedrichshafen in 2016

We decided this year not to go to the Outdoors in Friedrichshafen. Actually, we have never been there butafter visiting the ISPO 2016 in Munich this year we decided that  we will visit the Outdoors in Friedrichshafen in 2017 and rather go on a few trips in July and combine it with a visit to Patrick's parents who are living closeby.

# Japan

Konstantin will travel for a few weeks to Japan to hike and packraft there. He has been there already last year and really enjoyed it there.

# Russia
After Japan, Konstantin will travel to Russia to packraft with a few other guys on the ... River.

# France
Straight after Russia he is planning to travel to France to participate in a packrafting whitewater course.

# Finland
Patrick is going to travel to Finnish Lapland for a packrafting and hiking adventure. Patrick ill also visit the Siida museum to learn a bit more about the culture and life of the Sami people in Finland.
