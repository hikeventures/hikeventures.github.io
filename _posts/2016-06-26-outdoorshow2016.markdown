# Four reasons why we don't visit the OutDoors in Friedrichshafen in 2016

We decided this year not to go to the Outdoors in Friedrichshafen. Actually, we have never been there butafter visiting the ISPO 2016 in Munich this year we decided that  we will visit the Outdoors in Friedrichshafen in 2017 and rather go on a few trips in July and combine it with a visit to Patrick's parents who are living closeby.
