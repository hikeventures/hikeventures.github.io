Last summer (July 2013) Fran Reisner of <a href="http://journeyinfocus.com" target="_blank">Journey in Focus</a> found herself drawn back to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks for the third time since embarking on her journey two-and-a-half years ago. "The diversity of landscape and wildlife found in these two parks is remarkable, and truly irresistible to me" she says.

While there Fran and three friends she has come to know during her journey set out early one morning for one of her longest day hikes to date;  Paintbrush Divid Loop. The loop follows Paintbrush Canyon high into the Tetons to Lake Solitude and back down Cascade Canyon to Jenny Lake.
