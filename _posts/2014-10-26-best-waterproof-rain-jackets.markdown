You might want to wear your waterproof jacket only occasionally e.g. if it starts raining or if it gets very windy but you will appreciate to stay dry and warm on the trail or if you perform any other outdoor activities in the long run.  Also consider taking lightweight waterproof [rain pants](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-rain-pants/ "Best Rain Pants 2016") with you.

**Weight:** 185 grams   
**Fabric:** 3L Pertex Shield  

The Rab Flashpoint Jacket is also a super light rain jacket. With 185 grams it's you won't feel it either in your backpack. Also a great jacket for trail running. Not as durable if you are planning to carry a backpack.

### Montane Minimus Jacket

**Weight:** 208 grams   
**Fabric:**  PERTEX Shield +  

The Montane Minimus Jacket is similar to the the Montane Minimus Smock with the difference that it has an adjustable hoody and a long The Montane Minimus Jacket is similar to the the Montane Minimus Smock with the difference that it has an adjustable hoody and a long front zipper to easily put on / off the jacket. This can be an advantage if you are in the mountains and is suddenly starts to rain. It also features an fully adjustable helmet compatible mountain hood. 

I would choose the Montane Minimus Jacket as my go-to jacket if every gram counts and you want to have a full-zip jacket. If durability is also an important aspect then you should have a look at the new Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket which comes next in my list.

### Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket

**Weight:** 335 grams   
**Fabric:** N40p-X 3L GORE-TEX

The Zeta LT Jacket would be my favourite choice if I would select a new waterproof jacket. It comes with the new Gore Tex GORE C-KNIT backer technology which should be super comfortable on the skin and even more breathable. There is also a lighter jacket out which is called Norvan Jacket and comes with only 215 grams. However, I would not choose it for packrafting as the fabric N20p 3L is quite thin compared to the Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket. The Norvan jacket is more suitable for runners or if you don't wear a backpack.

## Best fabric for waterproof jackets
You should look for a waterproof jacket which is made of light fabrics. In terms of e.g. GORE-TEX, I would opt for GORE-TEX Active Shield or the new GORE C-KNIT backer technology which comes with the new Arcteryx Zeta LT Jacket. However, you will sweat in all waterproof jackets if you are active.

My advice would be to use a [wind jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-windjackets/ "Wind Jackets") when it is not raining and switch to a rain jacket once it starts raining. At least this has worked out best for me on my hiking trips.

Nonetheless, if you are planning to use your jacket for skiing or snowboarding a more durable fabric like GORE-TEX ProShell or in certain cases also the GORE-TEX Active or GORE C-KNIT fabric would be more suitable rather than a thin Pertex Shield + fabric as you don't want to get immediately a hole into your jacket.

However, if you want to have a light jacket for hiking or backpacking which packs easyly into your backpack then the lighter jackets from Berghaus, Rab or Montane are a good options from my experience.
