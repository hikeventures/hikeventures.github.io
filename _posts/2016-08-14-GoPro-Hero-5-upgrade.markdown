The main difference between the GoPro Hero 4 Black and the GoPro Hero 5 Black is that the Hero 5 Black you can actually record audio as the GoPro Hero 5 Black does not need a camera housing anymore.

## 4K Video Quality
The 4K video option remains similar. Both camera models can record 4K with 30 FPS. 

## Picture Quality
Both GoPro's have a 12MP camera with Æ’/2.8.

## Weight
The weight of the GoPro Hero 4 Black with housing is about 152 grams while the GoPro Hero 5 Black weights only 118 grams.

## Battery
The battery capacity has increased from 1160 mAh to 1220mAh.

## Video stabilization
The GoPro Hero 5 Black has video stabilization while the GoPro Hero 4 Black does not.

## Touchscreen
The GoPro Hero 5 Black has also a touch screen while you have to buy a separate touchscreen for the GoPro Hero 4 Black. 

## Location Capture
The GoPro Hero 5 offers location capture so you always know where you have recorded your video.

# Conclusion
Now the question remains if you should upgrade from your GoPro Hero 4 Black to the GoPro Hero 5 Black. Well, if you need Video stabilization and want to record audio when you do water sports then the GoPro Hero 5 Black is definitely the camera you should upgrade to. Since it also comes with a touch screen you can safe another 70 EUR in buying an additional touchscreen for your GoPro Hero 4 Black. I also found the price quire reasonable with only 400 EUR which is 100 EUR less than what you have paid when the GoPro Hero 4 Black came out. If you you don't need image stabilization, location capture and raw images then you should definitely look into the new GoPro Session as well as it offers the same specs as the regular model just in a smaller camera body.
