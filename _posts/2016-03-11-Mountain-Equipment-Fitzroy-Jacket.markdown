On our trip to Scotland I took my light Montbell Down UL Down Jacket with me. Initially, I thought that my jacket would be sufficient but realised later on that it was probably a smart choice to purchase a Mountain Equipment Fityroy Jacket. Having done some research on synthetic jackets before our Scotland trip I was already quite sure to get the Mountain Equipment Fitzroy Jacket if I would find it for a good price as winter sales was going on.

Once we arrived in Edinburgh we had a stroll through the city where we passed by a couple of outdoor stores and I was lucky to find a really good deal on the Fitzroy jacket. After my purchase I felt much better going camping in a tent on subzero degrees even so I had my regular Cumulus 450 sleeping bag and my Katabatic Chisos Quilt with me. A down jacket probably would have not worked very well if we would have been exposed to rain. Luckily we had 2 days of sun shine and on the third day the weather became quite nasty with strong winds and rain in the evening. However, it's always good to be on the safe side.

I was wearing my Fitzroy jacket everyday as soon as we got out of our dry suites. The jacket is really comfortable to wear and the 2 zipped hand warmer pockets with microfleece lining helped to warm up my hands as well while walking around in the camp. The Fitzroy jacket was also perfect to wear in the sleeping bag. 

The advantage of the synthetic Fitzroy jacket over my old Montbell down jacket is that the Fitzroy would have kept me warm even so when it becomes wet. Especially in very wet or humid conditions a down jacket just won't work. The Fitzroy can be worn also as a layer on top of a hard shell as the Fitzroy is not a waterproof but a water resistan jacket.

The Fitzroy also comes with a stuff bag. Obviously, a synthetic jacket does not pack as small as a down jacket but I prefer to have a jacket with me which keeps me warm in every condition. Especially, when you do packrafting then there is always a chance that your clothes might get wet. But also for winter activities like snow shoeing a synthetic jacket might be a better choice than a down jacket. The disadvantage of the synthetic jacket is that it does not keep you that warm as a down jacket but I was perfectly happy with the Fitzroy jacket at -2 C.

## Technology

The Mountain Equipment Fitzroy Jacket comes with Primaloft® GOLD and DRILITE® Loft. Those are one of the best synthetic materials for insulation.

## Price
It is less pricey than an equivalent down jacket. However, the Fitzroy might have more weight (645 grams) and and take more space in your backpack than an equivalent down jacket.
