Since I have been living in Finland since 2006 I have read a lot about the history and 

culture of Finland and other Nordic countries. Food is also part of culture so I decided to 

read a bit more about the Scandinavian kitchen and came across Michele Genest book 

called "The Boreal Feast" which covers culinary aspects of Finland, Norway and Sweden.

The Boreal Feast has 256 pages so it's quite extensive. The author seperated the book 

according to the seasons and embellished the book with beautiful pictures throughout 

the book. In this book you can find 12-course menu but also very simple dishes and drinks. It also covers ingredients like mushrooms birch syrup or blueberries or Panna Cotta in a more Scandinavian style.
