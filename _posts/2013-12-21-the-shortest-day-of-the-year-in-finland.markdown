Today is the shortest day of the year. In Finland sunrise is expected to be at 10.13 in Vaasa and sunset at 14.51 - 4.5h sunshine in total.

Vaskiluoto harbour between Vaasa and Sundom. I took this picture on the way to my final destination - &#214;jberget - the highest elevation in the area.<br><br>

Ice Fishing Season has started again even so there is not much snow yet in Vaasa and temperatures are not that low. Today we just had 0 C. The shortest day of the year in Finland is really short compared to the Alps where I originally come from.
