A portable and lightweight camping stove is one of the most essential item to have on your adventures to boil water for tea, coffee or dehydrated meals. Here comes my buying guide with the best lightweight camping stoves in 2016 for your next hiking, backpacking, packrafting, mountaineering or any other backcountry trip. The stoves in this guide are sorted by their weight. Also it's a good idea to have a <a href="http://amzn.to/22kZs72" rel="nofollo">Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel</a> with you even so the stove offers an igniter as there is a possibility that the igniter may break during your trip. I would also pack <a href="http://amzn.to/22kZs72" rel="nofollo">Swedish FireSteel</a> into my backpack rather than matches. Matches can get wet but with the <a href="http://amzn.to/22kZs72" rel="nofollo">Swedish FireSteel</a> you don't have to worry about that. Just make sure that you know how to use the <a href="http://amzn.to/22kZs72" rel="nofollo">Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel</a> before you set out to the backcountry.

**Weight:** 73 grams   
**Burn Time:** 3.5 min   
**Fuel:** Gas

## [MSR WindPro II](http://www.omcgear.com/msr-windpro-ii-stove-1.html)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005I6PNZS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005I6PNZS&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=NCXX5MK756QD4MWS"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B005I6PNZS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005I6PNZS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />   

**Weight:** 187 grams   
**Burn Time:** 3.6 minutes       
**Fuel:** Gas   

The MSR WindPro II is a nice stove for those who want to have the burner separated which gives more stability but also the possibility to keep the gas canister warm in colder temperatures. The MSR WindPro II also simmers quite well and the larger diameter of the burner lets you allow to use larger pots. If you are planning to travel in more harsh conditions then the MSR XGK EX would be a better choice.

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NPPWOJ2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NPPWOJ2&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=G7LF7ACULXJOSCLX"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPPWOJ2&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00NPPWOJ2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 432 grams   
**Burn Time:** 2 min 30 seconds for 0.5 liter

**Cooking cup size:** 1 liter   

The MSR WindBurner is the latest addition on the stove market from MSR. This stove is marketed to operate very well under windy conditions. The MSR WindBurner is currently our favourite stove on our trips (for 2 person) even so it weights a little bit more than the other stoves. If you are traveling alone then the Jetboil MiniMo might be a good alternative.

## How to choose the best camping stove?
It all depends on your requirements. Do you need a simple and lightweight camping stove then the MSR MicroRocket would be a good choice but your stove won't have any wind protection and you need an aditional cup to boil the water. 

My preference goes towards a camping stove which boils water quickly and uses low amount of fuel as I am usually traveling with dehydrated food packages where I just have to add boiling water to the food package. My favourite stove for Scandinavia are the [MSR WindBurner](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-windboiler-personal-stove-system) or the [Jetboil MiniMo](http://www.backcountry.com/jetboil-minimo-cooking-system) - both of them can also handle cold temperatures down to -6C while the MSR WinBurner stove can handle wind better than the Jetboil MiniMo.

If you are traveling to different continents then a multi-fuel stove might be the best solution as gas canisters might not be sold everywhere. For winter camping you should probably also consider a multifuel stove like the [MSR XGK EX](http://www.backcountry.com/msr-xgk-ex-stove).
