This week I went to the ISPO in Munich to look for new interesting products for our [hiking and packrafting adventures][1] and here is a short ISPO review. We had great outdoor adventures this year in [Finnish Lapland][2] and for 2015 I would be interested to [test][3] new outdoor gear. I started the day at 8.45 at the press centre where I received my press ID just right in time as the show started at 9 am. I focused my day on certain companies I was interested in and those which won an ISPO Award 2015.

## Fischer E 109 Crown Xtralite
The Fischer E 109 Crown Xtralite is a very popular backcountry ski which I might consider to own myself in the future. But still have to make up my mind between the Fischer and the Madshus backcountry skis.

## Thule Legend Backpack
The Thule Legend Backpack is an interesting product for those who are looking for a backpack with a dedicated compartment for their GoPro hero camera. We got some gear to test from Thule and you will read about it in one of our upcoming blog posts. [Subscribe][4] to our RSS feed if you want to stay updated.

## Thule Pack ’n Pedal iPad/Map Sleeve
If you are planning to go on a longer bicycle trip using your ipad as a digital map then Thule offers a nice solution which keeps your ipad dry.

## Marker Kingpin
The Marker Kingbin is an ISPO Award Winner 2015 and might be an interesting solution who are looking for a ski tour binding.

## Therm-A-Rest EvoLite
The Therm-A-Rest EvoLite is a light down sleeping pad for 3-seasons. The regular version weights around 520 grams and due to it's compact foam it can be packed quite small. I have recently ordered a new Therm-a-rest NeoAir Xtherm but would be interested in having the EvoLite as a sleeping pad for the warmer months.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15841994493" title="Therm-A-Rest EvoLite"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/15841994493_8b47c96b4e_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Therm-A-Rest EvoLite"></a>

## MSR Winboiler 1.0L
The new MSR Windboiler. Not sure if the Windboiler is better than the Jetboil stove but looks interesting.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16460337191" title="MSR Windboiler 1.0"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/16460337191_9e96f09e2e_b.jpg" width="961" height="1024" alt="MSR Windboiler 1.0"></a>

## MSR Ascent Lightning
One of the most advanced MSR snowshoes. MSR also offers tails which can be attached to the back of the snowshoes. Konstantin has a pair of MSR Ascent snowshoes which he has also tested in [Lapland][5] but I am using the [Tubbs Xpedition Snowshoes][6] at the moment.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16436085966" title="MSR Ascent Lightning"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16436085966_1f81900fa4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="509" alt="MSR Ascent Lightning"></a>

## MSR Flight 3
I found the MSR Flight 3 quite interesting. They felt light and quite solid. I might look more into those poles in the future. Currently, I have the [Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles][7] but they are not suitable for my snowshoeing activities in the winter since you can not attach snow baskets on them.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15839553254" title="MSR Flight 3"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8589/15839553254_e88cfc051c_b.jpg" width="790" height="1024" alt="MSR Flight 3"></a>

## Primus Stoves
A selection of different Primus Stoves available. Not sure if MSR, Jetboil or Primus has better stoves. I guess at the end it's more a personal choice about brands.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274655170" title="Primus Stove"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7369/16274655170_728739bff8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="974" alt="Primus Stove"></a>

## Powertraveller Powermonkey Explorer 2
The Powertraveller Powermonkey Explorer 2 is an ISPO Award Winner 2015. The Powermonkey Explorer 2 can also be charged manually with the small item left to it. I have a [Solarmonkey Adventurer][8] from Powertraveller. However, I have some issues getting my phone fully charged with it. Maybe it's better to have a bigger solar panel on the trips.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16436088546" title="Powermonkey Explorer 2"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/16436088546_9359e5c62e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="785" alt="Powermonkey Explorer 2"></a>

## Optimus Fuel
The Optimus Fuel is an ISPO Award Winner 2015. It felt very solid and you can easily switch between different fuels without doing any special adjustments beforehand. Quite useful for longer trips.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274389748" title="Optimus Fuel"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7328/16274389748_248d590e3d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="923" alt="Optimus Fuel"></a>

## Aquapac TrailProof
One of the waterproof bags which could be interesting for our packrafting adventures like our trip to the [Sarek National Park][9] in Sweden. Unfortunately, it is not allowed to packraft there anymore.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274658030" title="Aquapac TrailProof"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7306/16274658030_99dafe50e1_b.jpg" width="708" height="1024" alt="Aquapac TrailProof"></a>

## Aquapac Waterproof Duffel
The Aquapac Waterproof Duffel would be also quite interesting for our [packrafting trips][10]. Unfortunately, it only comes with max. 90l so it might be more suited for shorter trips if you plan to do hiking as well. Otherwise it looks like a really nice product which could be adjusted easily on a packraft.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15839558494" title="Aquapac Waterproof Duffel"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7352/15839558494_a198877bff_b.jpg" width="821" height="1024" alt="Aquapac Waterproof Duffel"></a>

## Yeti Cirrus Down Jacket
ISPO Award Winner 2015 and the lightest down jacket (at the time of the exhibition) on the market. The jacket for women weights around 140 grams (size S) and 900+ cuin. Currently, I am having the [Montbell U.L. Down Parka][11] which I am quite happy with even so it has less cuin.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274405188" title="Yeti Cirrus Down Jacket"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/16274405188_b52db37b7a_b.jpg" width="898" height="1024" alt="Yeti Cirrus Down Jacket"></a>

## Sea to Summit Comfort Plus insulated
The Sea to Summit Comfort Plus is an ISPO Award Winner 2015. It features a 2 layer system to adjust the mattress to your needs. It can also be considered as a safety feature. Let's say you get a hole into the bottom layer then you can sill use the upper layer as an insulation layer. In the past I have used the [Exped SynMat UL 7][12] sleeping pad but looking forward to test the Therm-a-rest NeoAir Xtherm on our packrafting trip in Sweden in April.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16462095295" title="Sea to Summit Comfort Plus Insulated"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/16462095295_ecbd7cf94a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="691" alt="Sea to Summit Comfort Plus Insulated"></a>

## Sea to Summit Spark SP II
The Sea to Summit Spark SP II features 850+ down and can be compressed quite small. Looks interesting as a 3-season sleeping bag. Would be nice to compare it with my [Cumulus Panyam 450][13]

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16460365611" title="Sea to Summit Spark SP II"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8564/16460365611_29f7732ffc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="342" alt="Sea to Summit Spark SP II"></a>.

## Haglöfs Barrier Pro III Hood
The Haglöfs Barrier Pro III Hood is an ISPO Award Winner 2015 and might be an interesting jacket for winer activities.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15842025163" title="Haglöfs Barrier Pro III Hood Men"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/15842025163_9bafc886ca_b.jpg" width="822" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs Barrier Pro III Hood Men"></a>

## Klettermusen
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15839578844" title="Klättermusen Jackets"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7369/15839578844_407908422d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="994" alt="Klättermusen Jackets"></a>

## Bergans Memurutind Down Jacket
The Bergans Memurutind Down Jacket looks quite interesting too. It does not have the highest down fill power but more down and an extended back which I found quite useful. Konstantin has an older model of this jacket and was very pleased with it. You can see it on our post about [Finnish Lapland][14].

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15842027653" title="Bergans Memurutind Down Jacket"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8672/15842027653_2ec7f94901_b.jpg" width="923" height="1024" alt="Bergans Memurutind Down Jacket"></a>

## Lundhags Fleet Ice Skates
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274414828" title="Lundhags Fleet"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8629/16274414828_3e3c623d33_b.jpg" width="1024" height="477" alt="Lundhags Fleet"></a>
## Lundhags Antjah
The Lundhags Antjah and the Lundhags Authentic Pro-Pants are high quality Trekking and Hiking pants. Would be interested to test them in the future as well. The Antjah is made of 65% polyester and 35% cotton and the lightest Lunhags pants. The pants can also be vented by opening zippers. Currently, I am having the [Arcteryx Palisade Pants][15] for the summer months and the Fjälräven Abisko pants for spring and autumn. Would be interested to see how they compare to the Lundhags Antjah or Authentic Pro-Pants.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16436114586" title="Lundhags Antjah"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8569/16436114586_5558af84aa_b.jpg" width="531" height="1024" alt="Lundhags Antjah"></a>

## Lundhags Authentic Pro-Pant
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16462105195" title="Lundhags Authentic Pro-Pant"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7395/16462105195_d325b386b3_b.jpg" width="503" height="1024" alt="Lundhags Authentic Pro-Pant"></a>

## Hestra Fjellvotten
I found the design of the Hestra gloves on the left hand side quite appealing for urban winter usage. The quality of the Hestra gloves looked quite good. Maybe next winter I will try to get a pair of them.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16461173902" title="Hestra Fjellvotten"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8651/16461173902_e5942e01d3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="740" alt="Hestra Fjellvotten"></a>

## Point 65n Modular
Looking for a modula kayak? Point 65n modular offers an interesting solution e.g. if you want to carry your kayak in the trunk of your car. However, I am not sure if I would exchange it with my [Alpacka Yukon Yak][16] packraft...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16436117896" title="Point 65N"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7420/16436117896_afd82d2eb8_b.jpg" width="569" height="1024" alt="Point 65N"></a>

## Mountain Hardwear Compressor Jacket
The Mountain Hardwear Compressor Jacket seems to be an interesting insulation layer for active outdoor activities. The company recommend this jacket on it's website for Alpine Climbing.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16275874309" title="Mountain Hardwear Compressor Jacket"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7343/16275874309_62e1920d88_b.jpg" width="736" height="1024" alt="Mountain Hardwear Compressor Jacket"></a>

## Mountain Hardwear K7
I asked Mountain Hardwear which jacket they would recommend for taking pictures in Lapland during the winter and they showed me the K7. Looks indeed nice and warm. Could be an interesting jacket for my photography activities during the next winter.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274421378" title="Mountain Heardware K7"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7347/16274421378_a8fde125ec_b.jpg" width="864" height="1024" alt="Mountain Heardware K7"></a>

## Mountain Hardwear Concordia Jacket
Mountain Hardwear also recommended me a fleece which I could use while doing activities like snowshoeing in Lapland as the K7 down jacket would be too warm for my purposes.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274422768" title="Mountain Hardwear Concordia Jacket"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8607/16274422768_8cf9ac4724_b.jpg" width="660" height="1024" alt="Mountain Hardwear Concordia Jacket"></a>
## Haglöfs Sector II Jacket
The Haglöfs Sector II Jacket is the wamest midlayer from Haglöfs for outdoor activities. It weights around 480 grams (L) and features Polartec Thermal Pro fabric as well as Polartec PowerStretch Pro.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274423878" title="Haglöfs Sector II Jacket"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16274423878_e6560f4394_b.jpg" width="1024" height="654" alt="Haglöfs Sector II Jacket"></a>

## Haglöfs Mojo Down Hood Jacket
Another intersting down jacket. Might need to add it to my list of the best [down jackets 2015][17].

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16275878899" title="Haglöfs Mojo Down Hood Jacket"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8591/16275878899_c206872839_b.jpg" width="1024" height="722" alt="Haglöfs Mojo Down Hood Jacket"></a>

## Haglöfs L.I.M. Jacket and Pants
The Haglöfs L.I.M. product range looks interesting to take with you on your hiking trips to protect from rain and wind. They are lightweight too. Compare them with other [waterproof pants for 2015][18].

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16461183832" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. Jacket and Pants"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7316/16461183832_92cab0d244_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M. Jacket and Pants"></a>

## Fjällräven Expedition Down Parka No. 1
The Fjällräven Expedition Down Parka No. 1 is an ISPO Award Winner 2015. This is a seriously warm jacket and a bit heavy too. Maybe a bit too warm for my needs.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16274428938" title="Fjällräven Expedition Down Parka No. 1"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8663/16274428938_a1bf286758_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Fjällräven Expedition Down Parka No. 1"></a>

## Fjällräven Keb Eco-Shell Jacket
The Fjällräven Keb Eco-Shell Jacket is an ISPO Award Winner 2015. Would be interesting to test this jacket on some snowshoeing trips. Those jackets should work quite well if it's cold and snowing and with the wax you can even waterproof them.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15842045493" title="Fjällräven Keb Eco-Shell Jacket"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7339/15842045493_faafd17017_b.jpg" width="1001" height="1024" alt="Fjällräven Keb Eco-Shell Jacket"></a>

## MSR Snow Shovel Responder
The MSR Snow Shovel Responder is an ultra-compact aluminium snow shovel which is designed to take with you in a day pack and weights around 598 grams. Might be an option for those folks who are into winter camping or backcountry snowboarding / skiing.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15839598864" title="MSR Shnow Shovel Responder"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8675/15839598864_f25f7fa6a9_b.jpg" width="703" height="1024" alt="MSR Shnow Shovel Responder"></a>

## MSR Beta, and MSR Basecamp
The MSR Beta is an ultralight snow saw and weights around 178 grams.

## Vaude Tents
I have spotted a couple of tents outside of the exhibition area but there were not many choices available. I would have been interested in a dome tent for packrafting.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16460389381" title="Vaude Tents"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/16460389381_e8572f5d96_b.jpg" width="1024" height="750" alt="Vaude Tents"></a>

## Superfeet Worldwide
ISPO Award Winner 2015. Might be interesting for those looking for personalised shoe insoles.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16276230217" title="Superfeet Worldwide"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8605/16276230217_b9a8fb4a9d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="979" alt="Superfeet Worldwide"></a>

## Fimbulvetr Snowshoes
ISPO Brand NewAward Winner 2014. If you need snowshoes which are super flexible then the Fimbulvetr Snowshoes might be an interesting option.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16275890299" title="Fimbulvetr Snowshoes"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7352/16275890299_898cb92537_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Fimbulvetr Snowshoes"></a>

## TSL Symbioz Snowshoes
Also the TSL Symbioz Snowshoes are highly flexible.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16436136096" title="TSL Symbioz Snowshoes"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8655/16436136096_8b745248f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="TSL Symbioz Snowshoes"></a>
## Madshus BC 50 MGV+ SKIS
Madshus is a Finnish ski manufacturer. Here is a backcountry ski model which does not require waxing and is the narrowest model of their backcountry platforms.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15839605214" title="Madshus BC 50 MGV+ SKIS"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/15839605214_1f47e77e97_b.jpg" width="465" height="1024" alt="Madshus BC 50 MGV+ SKIS"></a>

## Elan AMPHIBIO 16 Ti2 Fusion
ISPO Award Winner 2015. The ski should offer edge grip and easy turning.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15839606694" title="Elan AMPHIBIO 16 Ti2 Fusion"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8658/15839606694_999a4940c7_b.jpg" width="478" height="1024" alt="Elan AMPHIBIO 16 Ti2 Fusion"></a>

## Rottefella Cross-Country Ski Bindings
If you are into backcountry or cross country skiing then Rottefella has good products which I might also test in the future once I get my own pair of backcountry skis.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16462129955" title="Rottefella Cross-Country Ski Binding"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7412/16462129955_06db273678_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Rottefella Cross-Country Ski Binding"></a>

## Tubbs Flex VRT
If the Tubbs Flex VRT perform better than my [Tubbs Xpedition Snowshoes][19]

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16276236687" title="Tubbs Flex VRT"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/16276236687_6b0d340728_b.jpg" width="1024" height="656" alt="Tubbs Flex VRT"></a>...

## Thule Pack ’n Pedal Smartphone Attachment
If you need to attach your smartphone on your bicycle the Thule Pack ’n Pedal Smartphone Attachment might be an option.

## Polar M400
ISPO Award Winner 2015. However, I still prefer my [Suunto Ambit3][20].

## Fenix 3
Garmin's latest GPS watch. The display looks quite nice but as a package I sill like my [Suunto Ambit3][21] more.

Lightning options offered by Black Diamond. We are currently happy with our [Luci Outdoor Latern][22] and [luminAID][23].

## Black Diamond Expedition 3 poles
The Black Diamond Expedition 3 poles looked interesting too. Not sure yet if I would go for the MSR Flight 3 poles or for those...

## Arcteryx Ceres Jacket
The Arcteryx Ceres Jacket looks like a nice down jacket which I could also use on my next Lapland trip during the winter. It features 850 cuin and has a weight of 850 grams.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/16436153776" title="Arcteryx Ceres Jacket"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7314/16436153776_c684898848_b.jpg" width="583" height="1024" alt="Arcteryx Ceres Jacket"></a>

## Arcteryx Lithic Glove
ISPO Award Winner 2015 and might be an interesting option if you are into Snowboarding or Skiing.

## Arcteryx Beta Shell Glove
If you prefer to use liners then the Arcteryx Beta Shell Glove could be your gloves.

## Arcteryx Nuclei AR Jacket
ISPO Award Winner 2015. The Arcteryx Nuclei AR Jacket weights 285 grams and features Coreloft insulation and can be packed away very small. If you need insulation in a wet environment then this jacket might be a better option than wearing a down jacket.

## BCA Float Avalanche Airbag
There were many exhibitors at the ISPO who promoted their avalanche airbags. Seems that there are many who go skiing off the marked piste. I have worked once in a mountain hut in Switzerland and witnessed the sound of an avalanche. I think even with such an airbag backpack I would not like to be caught by an avalanche.

## LED Lenser NEO
ISPO Award Winner 2015. The LED Lenser NEO features 90 lumen and brightens up the area up to 10 m in front of you. Weight is 54 grams. This seems to be indeed an interesting product for those who go running in the evenings. I have currently a [Petzl Nao][24] with a belt kit but the Lenser NEO would do the job as well. I have also compiled a list with [good headlamps][25].

## LED Lenser XEO 19R
The LED Lenser XEO 19R features 2000 lumen and weights 192 grams without batteries. The XEO 19R can lighten up the area in front of you up to 300 m.

## NIKWAX Down Wash Direct
Well, I use Nikwax as well. Bit expensive but works quite well to get my outdoor clothes and sleeping bags clean.

## Inov-8 Terraclaw 250
ISPO Award Winner 2015. I have used the [Inov-8 Roclite 295][26] in the past and they worked quite well for me. The problem with those shoes is that your foot gets wet quite soon as I have experienced it on my hike in the [Sarek National Park][27]. For such a trip I would rather prefer proper hiking boots.

## Q500 Typhoon Drone
Drones are currently high in demand. I was thinking myself of getting one of such a drone but then it's quite questionable if it's legally allowed to fly with them. So no drone for me at the moment.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15842090663" title="Q500 Typhoon Drone"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/15842090663_69afc55bff_b.jpg" width="1013" height="1024" alt="Q500 Typhoon Drone"></a>

This was the first time for me being at the ISPO in Munich. It was quite an experience to see all those different outdoor brands and to meet some people which I previously only knew from mailing or social media. I might go there next year again.

Contact me if you will be there as well!
