Recently, I have read many interesting blog posts discussing if you should consider taking rain gear i.e. rain jacket and rain pants with you when going hiking. This is an interesting question especially for those who are into ultralight hiking. But what means ultralight? Should you pack as less as possible or should you only try to minimise weight on all the gear you need on the hike?

From my point of view leaving your rain clothes at home could cause hypothermia especially if you go hiking for several hours or days.

Personally, I go hiking because I want to enjoy the nature and not to proof that I have done a certain trip with the lowest weight. From my experience your body adjusts to the weight you are carrying after 1 or 2 days.

The philosophy of ultralight hiking is that you feel more comfortable on your hike when you carry less. However, leaving essential items like a rain jacket at home may cause discomfort as well when it starts raining.

I believe that the ultralight principle should only be applied on gear to cut weight on essentials but only in a way that your gear is still functional.

So should you take your rain jacket and pants on your next hiking trip. I would say: "Yes, definitely if you want to enjoy your time outdoors as much as possible and stay healthy".
