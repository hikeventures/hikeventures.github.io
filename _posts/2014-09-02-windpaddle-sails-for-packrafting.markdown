With my packraft I used to paddle a lot in rivers and lakes. I was paddling sometimes for hours and at some point I was thinking that it would be really cool to have a sail or some sort of engine on your packraft.

Recently, I was surfing on <a href="http://valppaus.com/post/packsail-away" target="_blank">Joni's blog</a> reading about his adventures with a windpaddle sail. So I contacted <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de">Packrafting-Store</a> and was told that they are going to sell soon WindPaddle Sails for Packrafts (small and big models) as the original sails are made for kayaks and canoes (bigger size).

They are part of their **Anfibio** product range. So I ordered the big model which weights around 400 grams and got it delivered today. Packed it has a diameter of 40 cm while unfold it's diameter is 120 cm.

The first thing you have to learn before you go Packrafting with a sail is to fold and unfold your Windpaddle sail. I have made a short video where you can see how it works. Actually, it's quite straightforward (even so I am not a folding pro yet).

Packraft with the sail on the front. Its not folded to it's smallest size but if you keep it like this you can also use it as a spraydeck and it unfolds easier.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/14953269730" title="Packsailing Windpaddle Packraft"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3860/14953269730_46a4332927_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packsailing Windpaddle Packraft"></a>The Windpaddle works well as a spraydeck (at least in the front).

Was really easy!

## Conclusion
The sail works well for wind speeds starting from 5m/s. Otherwise, it just feels too slow. Having a sail on the Packraft is lots fun. <a hef="http://www.hikeventures.com/Second-Finnish-Packrafting-Gathering-Finland-Helvetinjarvi/">Here</a> is another blog post where you can see the windpaddle sail in action.
