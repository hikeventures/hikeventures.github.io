To protect yourself agains cold winds on the trail you should pack a lightweight wind jacket into your backpack when you go hiking, backpacking, climbing, cycling, running or plan any other backcountry trip. A windbreaker does not need much space so you can easily store it in your backpack. Also make sure that you buy a hooded wind jacket and not a wind pullover. Here is my buying guide of the best wind jackets for men in 2016.

Patrick hiking in [Sarek National Park](http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Best Wind Jackets 2016") in Sweden wearing an [Arcteryx Squamish Hoody](http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-arcteryx-squamish-hoody/ "Arcteryx Squamish Hoody") wind jacket

## Windproof or Waterproof?
A wind jacket is much lighter and you won't sweat that much in it compared to a [waterproof rain jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-waterproof-rain-jackets/ "Best Rain Jackets"). My own preference goes towards carrying both - a wind jacket AND a rain jacket with me and to wear them according to the current weather situation. If it's raining, I am obviously going to wear a waterproof jacket but if it's dry and there is only a cold wind blowing then I quickly pull on a wind jacket over my [fleece](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-fleece-jackets/ "Best Fleece Jackets"). 

In the evenings while sitting in the camp I then swap my [fleece](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-fleece-jackets/ "Fleece Jackets") and wind jacket combo with a [down jacket](#) which keeps me warm when I am sitting around.

## Deals
It's always a good idea to check deals on wind jackets if you are on a budget. Here is a list of current wind jacket deals from severl outdoor stores in the U.S.:

### Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer Hooded Jacket
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DH44IEU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DH44IEU&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=4GK24YGHCR22L4NQ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00DH44IEU&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DH44IEU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 59 grams   
**Fabric:** Whisperer 7D x 10D Ripstop   

The Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer Hooded Jacket is similar as the lighter Anorak model however it comes with a hood. In case of wind jackets I would go for a hooded model on your next hiking trips. Our Editor's Choice when low weight should be the most important factor.
