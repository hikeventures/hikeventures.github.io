To protect yourself agains cold winds on the trail you should pack a lightweight wind jacket into your backpack when you go hiking, backpacking, climbing, cycling, running or plan any other backcountry trip. A windbreaker does not need much space so you can easily store it in your backpack. Also make sure that you buy a hooded wind jacket and not a wind pullover. Here is my buying guide of the best wind jackets in 2016.

Patrick hiking in [Sarek National Park](http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Best Wind Jackets 2016") in Sweden wearing an [Arcteryx Squamish Hoody](http://hikeventures.com/gear-review-arcteryx-squamish-hoody/ "Arcteryx Squamish Hoody") wind jacket.

# Should your hiking jacket be waterproof or only windproof?
A wind jacket is much lighter and you won't sweat that much in it compared to a [rain jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-rain-jackets/ "Best Rain Jackets"). My own preference goes towards carrying both - a wind jacket AND a rain jacket - and to wear them according to the current weather situation. If it's raining, I am obviously going to wear a rain jacket but if it's dry and there is only a cold wind blowing then I quickly pull on a wind jacket over my [fleece](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-fleece-jackets/ "Best Fleece Jackets"). 

In the evenings while sitting in the camp I swap my [fleece](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-fleece-jackets/ "Fleece Jackets") and wind jacket combo with a [down jacket](http://www.hikeventures.com/best-down-jackets/).

# Conclusion
There is probably not much difference between the wind breakers in my buying guide about the best wind jackets and it's more about your own preference towards color and brand. I am wearing the [Arcteryx Squamish Hoody](http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-squamish-hooded-jacket-mens) since years and I am quite happy with it. Konstantin just recently got a [Patagonia Houdini](https://www.rei.com/product/893303/patagonia-houdini-jacket-mens) and is also very pleased with it.
