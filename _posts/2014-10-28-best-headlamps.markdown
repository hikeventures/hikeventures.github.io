A good lightweight led headlamp is an essential part for many outdoor activities likes hiking, running, cycling, A good lightweight led headlamp is an essential part for many outdoor activities likes hiking, running, cycling, packrafting, ski touring or climbing or any other backcountry trip. 

I have recently decided to upgraded my headlamp and compared different models online. Here is my buying guide of the best headlamps for 2016 sorted by Lumen (total amount of visible light). Personally, I like the Petzl Nao most since it has plenty of features and also offers the Petzl Nao Belt Kit which allows me to carry the battery under the jacket rather than on my head which can shorten the beattery life especially in [colder regions](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/). I have also used the previous model of the Nao in [Swedish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Swedish Lapland").

### [Petzl Nao](http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-nao-headlamp)

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMCATH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMCATH4&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=NB7B66USP2WK5M3D"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMCATH4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMCATH4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 187 grams   
**Lumen:** 575   
**Awards:** ISPO Award 2012   
**Watertightness:** IP X4 (water resistant)

The [Petzl Nao](http://hikeventures.com/petzl-nao-headlamp-test/ "Petzl Nao") features over 575 lumen, 200 Lumen more than the old model. It's reactive lightning system let's you also adjust the light level automatically without turning or pushing any buttons on the headlamp. You are able to charge the battery of the Petzl Nao within 5 hours. Usually, I also take an additional battery with me such as the Anker Astro E5 to charge my headlamp and other USB devices during my trips. You can also adjust the straps not the sides and on the top. I also have the [Petzl Nao Belt Kit](http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-nao-belt-kit), which allows me to carry the battery in my backpack or on my belt rather than on my head. It does not just feel better to have less weight on your head but also prevents battery drain if the temperatures are low. With the OS by Petzl you are also able to adjust the light levels on your PC / Mac. The Petzl Nao is my preferred headlamp! If you are looking for a lighter headlamp which can also be charged by USB then have a look at the Petzl Tikka RXP.

### [Petzl Tikka RXP](http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tikka-rxp-headlamp)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BA4R43Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00BA4R43Q&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=BMMHTF6L4KCESYEM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00BA4R43Q&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00BA4R43Q" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 115 grams   
**Lumen:** 215   
**Awards:** ISPO Award Gold Winner 2013   
**Watertightness:** IP X4 (water resistant)

Almost half the Lumen power of the Petzl Nao,  the Petzl Tikka RXP is much lighter than the Nao. If you don't like to carry the additional battery pack on the back of your head and prefer a less bulky headlamp then the Tikka RXP could be your choice. The Tikka RXP also features Petzl's reactive lightning system. The Tikka RXP should also be a great headlamp for trail running too. The USB port on the headlamp also allows you to charge The Tikka RXP with a battery bank like the Anker Astro E5. A less pricey alternative to the Petzl Tikka RXP would be the Black Diamon ReVolt. However, it does not have [reactive lightning](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/REACTIVE-LIGHTING-technology). Personally, I think reactive lightning is a nice to have feature but not something I would spend additional money on it.

### [Black Diamond Icon](http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-icon-headlamp)   

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FNCPBE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005FNCPBE&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=WBUHJA3GU3TCBJXQ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B005FNCPBE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005FNCPBE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 220 grams   
**Lumen:** 200      
**Awards:** Top Pick - Outdoor Gear Lab 2014, Editors Choice Award 2014 - Fish Alaska  
**Watertightness:** IP X7 (watertight)
     
With 220 grams and 'only' 200 Lumen, the Black Diamond Icon has a much lower Lumen/Weight ratio. For very wet conditions you should probably go for the Black Diamond Icon. However, with it's external battery it needs probably more room in your backpack and you will also carry more weight on your head.

**Weight:** 39 grams (excl. batteries)   
**Lumen:** 1090  
**Watertightness:** IP X7 (watertight)

[Jaakko](http://korpijaakko.com/ "Jaako") suggested me the Zebralight H600 Mk II. It features lot's of power for little weight. However, it has no USB connection to charge it's battery. If you don't mind carrying additional battieries with you then the Zebralight might be a great choice too.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HIW1I2C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HIW1I2C&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=LCSF7G25EDO752O5"><button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Read more about the Zebralight H600 Mk II</button></a>

The Princeton Tec Apex is the brightest headlamp Princeton Tec has to offer. It's battery is also located on the back of the head. Unfortunately, this headlamp does not offer any recharging possibilities via USB so you have to rely on 4 AA batteries.

### [Petzl e+LITE](http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-elite-emergency-headlamp)  

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AUBOTS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008AUBOTS&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=V5A2XQXJ3LK3X3NP"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B008AUBOTS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B008AUBOTS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 27 grams   
**Lumen:** 26  
**Watertightness:** IP X7 (watertight)

The Petzl e+LITE is the emergency headlamp from Petzl. It could also be a good choice for ultralight enthusiasts who can manage with less light. It can be used in a temperature range from -30C to +60C and it's batteries can be stored for 10 years. If you want to see more into the distance then this is probably not the headlamp you should consider to buy.

The [Petzl Nao](http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-nao-headlamp) headlamp is my favourite headlamp model.

## What makes a good headlamp?
When deciding which headlamp you should purchase, you have to consider the factors below and if they are applicable for your outdoor adventure needs. Should your headlamp be:

* waterproof or water resistant?
* lightweight?
* pack small e.g. for running or ultralight backpacking?
* adjust it's light automatically?
* rechargeable with USB in case you carry a USB battery as I do in order to be able to charge my [Suunto Ambit3](http://www.hikeventures.com/suunto-ambit3-ambit2-worth-upgrade/ "Suunto Ambit 3") and camera gear as well?
* easy adjustable with gloves for winter activities?
* used in very cold condition (to carry the battery nearby your body to avoid battery drain)?
* comfortable to wear?
* battery life on each recharge?
