A good lightweight led headlamp is an essential part for many outdoor activities likes hiking, running, cycling, A good lightweight led headlamp is an essential part for many outdoor activities likes hiking, running, cycling, packrafting, ski touring or climbing or any other backcountry trip. 

Since I recently decided to upgraded my headlamp, I compared different models online and here is my buying guide of the best headlamps for 2016 sorted according to Lumen (total amount of visible light). Personally, I like the Petzl Nao most. I have also used the previous model of the Nao in [Swedish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/ "Swedish Lapland").

### Petzl Nao 

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMCATH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LMCATH4&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=NB7B66USP2WK5M3D"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMCATH4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00LMCATH4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 187 grams   
**Lumen:** 575   
**Awards:** ISPO Award 2012   

The [Petzl Nao](http://hikeventures.com/petzl-nao-headlamp-test/ "Petzl Nao") features over 575 lumen, 200 Lumen more than the old model. It's reactive lightning system let's you also adjust the light level automatically without turning or pushing any buttons on the headlamp. You are able to charge the battery of the Petzl Nao within 5 hours. Usually, I also take an additional battery with me such as the [Anker Astro 3E](http://hikeventures.com/how-to-charge-your-batteries-when-you-are-outdoors/ "Anker Astro") to charge my headlamp and other USB devices during my trips. You can also adjust the straps not the sides and on the top. I also have the Petzl Nao [belt kit](http://bit.ly/1pVhFUd "belt kit"), which allows me to carry the battery in my backpack or on my belt rather than on my head. It does not just feel better to have less weight on your head but also prevents battery drain if the temperatures are low. With the OS by Petzl you are also able to adjust the light levels on your PC / Mac. The Petzl Nao is my preferred headlamp!

### Petzl Tikka RXP

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BA4R43Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00BA4R43Q&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=BMMHTF6L4KCESYEM"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00BA4R43Q&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00BA4R43Q" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 115 grams   
**Lumen:** 215   
**Awards:** ISPO Award Gold Winner 2013   

Almost half the Lumen power of the Petzl Nao,  the Petzl Tikka RXP is much lighter than the Nao. If you don't like to carry the additional battery pack on the back of your head and prefer a less bulky headlamp then the Tikka RXP could be your choice. The Tikka RXP also features Petzl's reactive lightning system. The Tikka RXP should also be a great headlamp for trail running too.
   
   
### Black Diamond Icon

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FNCPBE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005FNCPBE&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=WBUHJA3GU3TCBJXQ"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B005FNCPBE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005FNCPBE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 220 grams   
**Lumen:** 200      
**Awards:** Top Pick - Outdoor Gear Lab 2014, Editors Choice Award 2014 - Fish Alaska  

With 220 grams and 'only' 200 Lumen, the Black Diamond Icon has a much lower Lumen/Weight ratio. However, the Black Diamond Icon seems  is waterproof (IP X7: 1 m under the water for 30 minutes) compared to the Petzl headlamps which are weather resistant (IP X4: resistant agains water splashes). For very wet conditions you should probably go for this headlamp. With the Icon you also have to carry it's battery pack on the back of your head.

   
   
### Zebralight H600 Mk II 18650 XM-L2

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HIW1I2C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HIW1I2C&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=SXRO3IZVWEGIXOPW"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00HIW1I2C&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00HIW1I2C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 39 grams (excl. batteries)   
**Lumen:** 1090  

The ZebraLight H600 Mk II 18650 XM-L2 is IP X7 waterproof and sports 1090 Lumen. [Jaakko](http://korpijaakko.com/ "Jaako") suggested this headlamp. Lot's of power for little weight. Has no USB connection to charge it's battery.

You can buy the Zebralight [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HIW1I2C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HIW1I2C&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=LCSF7G25EDO752O5 "Zebralight").
   
   
### Princeton Tec Apex

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F5EA7LI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00F5EA7LI&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=CBMFG5EQHMBGE3I5"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5EA7LI&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00F5EA7LI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 279 grams   
**Lumen:** 275  

The Princeton Tec Apex is the brightest headlamp Princeton Tec has to offer. It's battery is also located on the back of the head. Unfortunately, this headlamp does not offer any recharging possibilities via USB so you have to rely on 4 AA batteries. The headlamp comes is IP X7 waterproof.
   
   
### Petzl Tikka R+

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BA4QMNY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00BA4QMNY&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=5VB3BSOOASMYDYBL"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00BA4QMNY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00BA4QMNY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

## What makes a good headlamp?
When deciding which headlamp you should purchase, you have to consider the factors below and if they are applicable for your outdoor adventure needs. Should your headlamp be:

* waterproof or water resistant?
* lightweight?
* pack small e.g. for running or ultralight backpacking?
* adjust it's light automatically?
* rechargeable with USB in case you carry a USB battery as I do in order to be able to charge my [Suunto Ambit3](http://www.hikeventures.com/suunto-ambit3-ambit2-worth-upgrade/ "Suunto Ambit 3") and camera gear as well?
* easy adjustable with gloves for winter activities?
* used in very cold condition (to carry the battery nearby your body to avoid battery drain)?
* comfortable to wear?
* battery life on each recharge?
