Here is my <a href="#table">selection</a> of the best synthetic insulated jackets for 2018 which I would consider buying for my next winter or hiking trip.

Wearing a synthetic insulated jacket over a <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/best-down-jackets/">down jacket</a> can have several reasons.

Either you are just looking for an alternative to down because of ethical reasons or you are planning to wear your jacket in a damp or humid environment where down may lose its insulation capabilities when it gets wet.

On our snowshoeing trip in [Finnish Lapland](http://www.hikeventures.com/snowshoeing-and-skiing-in-urho-kekkonen-national-park-and-Saariselka/), we could choose between wearing a synthetic or down jacket due to the low humidity.

## Our interview with the North Face

Konstantin interviewing the North Face at the ISPO 2016 about their product highlights.

Hi, this is Konstantin, and I've got Michael, the product director from The North Face.

Hi, Michael. What are the two, three highlights of the season?

So one of our key highlights is our Thermoball series here. Thermoball is our way to introduce an alternative to down.

So when you think about thermal insulation, down feathers are one of the best elements that you can have. Really captures the air good. The problem with down feathers is once it gets wet, it clumps together and loses all its abilities to create insulation.

So our solution for this is Thermoball, which is a synthetic version here. Basically what it does, even if it's wet, it keeps its shape and therefore its thermal insulation.

So really one of the big benefits here compared to down. Even if it's wet or if it's damp, or a little bit clumped, it keeps the insulation properties.

So that's one of the innovations that we have. We apply it to various different products.  A lot of jackets and snow sports where we apply this.
