Last weekend we decided to visit the Kurjenrahka National Park with <a href="http://caide.kuvat.fi">Caj</a> and Katja. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.gridnevskiy?fref=ts" rel="nofollow">Konstantin</a> has just finished his "official work duties" where he was talking on the 25th Nordic Symposium on Tourism and Hospitality Research in Turku and decided to stay a few more days. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/patrickdormischian">Patrick</a> has already visited the Kurjenrahka National Park <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/autumn-colors-around-lake-savojarvi/">2 years ago</a> for a day hike but this time we were planning to stay over night in a lean-to shelter. After we parked our car nearby the Kurjenpesä Nature Information Hut from where we walked to the old boundary mark of Kuhankuono.

The trail continued through swamps and since we arrived quite late the sun was setting also slowly.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29454438693/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5790/29454438693_03eede225c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, we had plenty of fun on the trail.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29998383301/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7761/29998383301_e39b7d336a_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From time to time we had a look on the map.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30081631975/in/dateposted-public/" title="KurjenrahkaNational Park Finland"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5699/30081631975_0dbc2ecd3e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="KurjenrahkaNational Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then we arrived at a dam where we had a nice view over the Savojärvi lake.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29998382291/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8557/29998382291_15e1c7fb20_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Those were probably the last warm autumn days in Southern Finland and the nights are already getting colder.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30081631035/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8762/30081631035_1cd31443fc_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Caj and Katja checking the map again.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29998381411/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5224/29998381411_c3cdd196d3_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It probably looked a bit scary when someone hiked towards us.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30081630295/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5185/30081630295_3d64b7b7fa_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1261" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Initially we planned to camp nearby this hut but the camp site was already occupied so we decided to hike for another 3 km to Läkijärvi where we hoped to find another lean-to shelter where we could stay over night.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29998380891/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8153/29998380891_5b91716b76_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1356" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The trail was quite well marked.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30081630025/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8352/30081630025_2977a94519_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Again it was time to check the map.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29786905800/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5480/29786905800_4b014c5555_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1149" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Once we reached Lakijärvi we prepared our camp fire and prepared our dinner. On our way to Lakijärvi we have also seen Northern Lights but once we arrived in Lakijärvi they were gone again.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30081628545/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8129/30081628545_7c3f792967_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Chatting and philosophizing at the fire.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30081628275/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5313/30081628275_919d55d06d_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After having had dinner we walked to the nearby Lakijärvi where we took a view pictures from the milky way.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29786904720/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5184/29786904720_8d74c8c6b4_k.jpg" width="1152" height="2048" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At 7 Caj and Konstantin were already up and playing with the fire. Patrick and Katja continued sleeping till 8 am. We had Karelian pie, toasted rie bread, ham and cheese for breakfast.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29786904310/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8424/29786904310_5f48d7d625_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Hmmm that is tasty...

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29967556592/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5607/29967556592_c97d180690_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After our breakfast we decided to go back to the nearby lake and to pick some cranberries.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30047569076/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5493/30047569076_201ede0497_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then we packed our gear and continued hiking around the lake Savojärvi.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29786904070/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8469/29786904070_5794a8fcfe_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The trail looked completely different during the day than it had looked the previous night.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30047568466/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8418/30047568466_1662c0e24f_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There were rocks and reindeer lichen (cladonia rangiferina) all over the place.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29786903810/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8115/29786903810_befc7d15a1_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

as well as blueberries...

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30047567646/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8822/30047567646_0c9cd59ad8_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

... so we had frequent stops to collect them.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/29967557582/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5129/29967557582_76caa3111b_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The trail around Savojärvi was truly beautiful. Hiking through a swamp always reminds me on hiking in Lapland where the trees are small as well.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/30047566786/in/dateposted-public/" title="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5244/30047566786_d75ec96356_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1152" alt="Kurjenrahka National Park Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After a few kilometers we arrived at the Kurjenpesä Nature Cabin where we walked down to the lake. The infrastructure to the lake was really good and makes the lake easy to reach if you visit it with a pram or as an elderly.
