description: Our trekking and packrafting adventures in the Japanese Alps
---
Last year we spent four days trekking in the Northern Alps of Japan - one of the most beautiful natural settings in Japan - which was a really special way to start our holidays.

## An unusual take of an iconic view 
Do you recognise where we were? It is one of the three most iconic views in Japan.

## Crossing one of a dozen of bridges on the Odai-Ga-Hara trail
Extremely beautiful, this trail is not for people who are afraid of heights. Closed due to a landslide for almost 10 years, it was reopened in 2014 giving us an opportunity to be done of the 'first' foreign hikers there when we walked it last summer.

## Sunset in Japan Northern Alps
The setting sun is beautiful (and romantic) anywhere. It can make even a total dumpster look special. However in the mountains, which are great on their own, the real magic happens. Where was your favourite subset ever? Do you remember?
     
## Bamboo
I am really really really fascinated with bamboo. Before I went to Japan, One of my dreams was to walk through a bamboo forest. And you know what? I haven't done it yet. This picture was taken in one of the three most beautiful/famous gardens in Japan - Koraku-en in Okayama. We went there with @gumngum and his two lovely sons. It was a very beautiful place indeed. But I still haven't been to a bamboo forest. Maybe this year.

## Packrafting in Japan
An important part of packrafting is scouting. Especially if the river has been changed out of all recognition by the torrential rains during a typhoon. Here @gumngum, @chang_narug and I are looking if it is possible to run the #shimanto river. And the answer to it - yes it was.


It was like walking above the clouds.
