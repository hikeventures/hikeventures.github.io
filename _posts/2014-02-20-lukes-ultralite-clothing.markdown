At Luke’s Ultralite we specialise in making the lightest possible in backpacking gear, by using the latest in materials.  Most of my products are sewn but when necessary or more practical a bonding method is used, like in our cuben fiber products.  If you see any product you would like to see in a different size or any custom addition this can more than likely be accommodated via email or calling me personally.   My number is 614-403-2476.

##WHY DID YOU START YOUR COMPANY
I originally started making gear for myself and my camping friends.  My friends liked the gear, gave me suggestions for additional gear to manufacture and the business took off from there.   The key was knowing what the camping community needed and wanted.

##WHAT ARE THE 3 BIGGEST BENEFITS TO YOUR TARGET CUSTOMERS AND WHY?

* All items are individually made and hand crafted 
* Lite weight gear appeals to both UL hikers and older hikers looking for an easier hiking experience
* All items are made in the USA

These benefits seem to be appealing to my new and many repeat customers

Advances in the types of materials used for camping gear and  the equipment used to produce it.

##HOW DO YOU STAY MOTIVATED DURING YOUR DARKEST HOUR?
Having served in Afghanistan with a Special Operations Team and going through many things in my life I stay motivated to not have dark hours in my life.
