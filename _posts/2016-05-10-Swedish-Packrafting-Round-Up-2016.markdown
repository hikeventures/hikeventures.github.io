description: The first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the River Voxnan
---
Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Henrik from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">Deliverance Team</a> organised the first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the river Voxnan in Sweden and we decided to sign up on this event on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Facebook</a>. This Packrafting Round-Up was also a great opportunity to meet <a href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpackaraft</a> - the manufacturer of our packrafts.
After a 4 hours drive from Stockholm we arrived on the starting point. We were 20 people from different countries. Everyone was busy with pitching the tent. This was a great opportunity to see gear from different brands and what people pack into their backpack.

Plenty of Hyperlite Mountain Gear was around like the Ultamid tarp. Probably need to get a new backpack by the end of the year as my HMG Porter is slowly wearing off. Just not sure if it's going to be white or black ...
