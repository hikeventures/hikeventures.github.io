description: The first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the River Voxnan
---
Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Henrik from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">Deliverance Team</a> organised the first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the river Voxnan in Sweden and we decided to sign up on this event on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Facebook</a>. This Packrafting Round-Up was also a great opportunity to meet <a href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpackaraft</a> - the manufacturer of our packrafts.
After a 4 hours drive from Stockholm we arrived on the starting point. We were 20 people from different countries. Everyone was busy with pitching the tent. This was a great opportunity to see gear from different brands and what people pack into their backpack.

Plenty of Hyperlite Mountain Gear was around like the Ultamid tarp. Probably need to get a new backpack by the end of the year as my HMG Porter is slowly wearing off. Just not sure if it's going to be white or black ...

Welcome to the HikeVentures tent. We had our little flag with is. It was much easier to find our tent again ... :)

That's how your trunk looks like when you go packrafting.

On the first day Henrik welcomed everyone and gave a short briefing.

While the others were still pitching their tents Konstantin, Patrick and Caj went for a short rapid ride on the Voxnan.

Enjoying the the first evening around the camp fire.

The next morning Konstantin prepared his breakfast sausage on our camp fire.

While <a href="http://urbanpackrafter.com/">Jacob</a> enjoyed fresh beacon.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26914515746/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7259/26914515746_0c3c39e7c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
After our breakfast we packed our gear and inflated our packrafts. Henrik gave another briefing about the trip and meeting points.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26914515216/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7632/26914515216_e6dc0a73f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
Last gear checks before riding the rapid with our packrafts.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26879917251/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7542/26879917251_be4d366273_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
Into the rapid. It took a while until everyone was with the packraft in the Voxnan river.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26914516236/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/26914516236_91b3c44d20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
Armada of Alpacka Rafts on the Voxnan. Which color do you like most? Green, Blue, Red or Banana Yellow?
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26359667893/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7747/26359667893_672395b16a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="580" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
While scouting the canyon we found remainings of a packrafter who tried to paddle through it. Was this a sign not to paddle through the canyon ...?
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26360809733/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7586/26360809733_8dcb469c01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
The canyon was probably one of the spots most of us enjoyed most.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26931622726/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7377/26931622726_34a8e1a27a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
Another exciting packrafter in the Canyon.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26965644515/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7103/26965644515_9c29933408_b.jpg" width="1024" height="593" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
 Caj who just recently got his packraft did exceptionally well in the rapids.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26931973676/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/26931973676_57bc87ac92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="605" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Henrik from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a> was pretty good in shape as well.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26361239754/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/26361239754_a706ac859c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
So was Carl from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a>
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26362311913/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7376/26362311913_ebf790923b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="607" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26361239644/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7503/26361239644_5d54f541ea_b.jpg" width="1024" height="536" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
... and Torbjörn
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26361240524/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7651/26361240524_7443be447b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="673" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
Queuing was quite common especially before a rapid.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26377302274/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7529/26377302274_23fb45b134_b.jpg" width="1024" height="548" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
There is hardly any rapid which can't be handled by the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">The Deliverance Team</a>
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26888501332/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7205/26888501332_e7c4b9f8ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="459" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Where is the next rapid?
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26888501672/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7783/26888501672_5515ca4f22_b.jpg" width="1024" height="637" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
This is Patrick from HikeVentures. You probably won't see him on many pictures since he is the guy who has to take them. Thanks to <a href="http://caide.kuvat.fi/">Caj</a> who took this picture.
       
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/26873718832/in/dateposted-public/" title="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7213/26873718832_c77a751c32_b.jpg" width="1024" height="875" alt="Swedish Packrafting Round-Up"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
       
Do you know what this is? No, you won't use it to knit fancy dry suites. This rope can rescue life in certain situations.

Some people prefer to stand when packrafting.

Packrafters are sometimes hard to spot in the rapid.

After the rapid is time to enjoy the nature and to relax.
