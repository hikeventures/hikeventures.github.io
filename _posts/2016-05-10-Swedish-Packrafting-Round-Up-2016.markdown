description: The first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the River Voxnan
---
Swedish Packrafting Round-Up - Henrik from the <a href="http://deliveranceteam.outdrr.com/">Deliverance Team</a> organised the first Swedish Packrafting Round-Up at the river Voxnan in Sweden and we decided to sign up on this event on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Facebook</a>. This Packrafting Round-Up was also a great opportunity to meet <a href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpackaraft</a> - the manufacturer of our packrafts.
After a 4 hours drive from Stockholm we arrived on the starting point. We were 20 people from different countries. Everyone was busy with pitching the tent. This was a great opportunity to see gear from different brands and what people pack into their backpack.

Plenty of Hyperlite Mountain Gear was around like the Ultamid tarp. Probably need to get a new backpack by the end of the year as my HMG Porter is slowly wearing off. Just not sure if it's going to be white or black ...

Welcome to the HikeVentures tent. We had our little flag with is. It was much easier to find our tent again ... :)

That's how your trunk looks like when you go packrafting.

Last evaluations if paddling would be faster with a different paddle.

Into the rapid. It took a while until everyone was with the packraft in the Voxnan river.
