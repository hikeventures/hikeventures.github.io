Today, I would like to present my current workflow using the Sony A7r and Lightroom on my Macbook Air, which is currently the lightest system to operate a full frame camera also on remote places.<br><br>

I purchased my [Sony A7r](http://amzn.to/1uA3RQx) a year ago and I am quite happy with it as I use it together with the [Sony 35mm F2.8 Sonnar T* FE ZA](http://amzn.to/1widRB9) lens mostly for landscape and macro photography. Currently, I am eying on the new Zeiss Loxia lenses which might be more suitable for manual focusing.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/15594218195" title="Sony A7r &amp; Slik Mini-Pro III"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15594218195_4e43a0d278_b.jpg" width="738" height="1024" alt="Sony A7r &amp; Slik Mini-Pro III"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In my current workflow, I connect my A7r (above mounted on a [Slik Mini-Pro III](http://amzn.to/1vIdMYC) tripod and the Macbook Air via USB in order to transfer the files from my [32 GB SanDisk Extreme Pro](http://amzn.to/1zjnrbC) SD card to my Macbook Air (I prefer this way rather than pulling the SD card in and out) even so the A7r has only a USB 2.0 socket.

Next, I open Lightoom which I have configured to auto import images and videos from the A7r to my external [Samsung M3](http://amzn.to/1uA2m4G) hard drive which is connected via USB 3.0 cable to my [Macbook Air](http://amzn.to/1zjmZKC). I prefer those 2.5 inch hard drives rather than those 3.5 inch hard drives as I am storing (and hiding) all my hard drives, wires, USB 3.0 hub and my extension lead in a [Bluelounge CableBin](http://amzn.to/1r99jbP) (see picture below).

While importing files into Lightroom, I also create smart preview files for each picture which are saved together with my Lightroom catalog on my external [Samsung 850 pro SSD](http://amzn.to/1wid1o7) which I dedicated exclusively to Lightroom. My SSD is pluged into an [Inateck SSD enclosure](http://amzn.to/1G8BeCI) which is connected via USB 3.0 to my Macbook Air.

After importing my files, I start sorting my pictures in [Adobe Lightroom](http://amzn.to/1yVhMrk) and delete those pictures where my manual focusing didn't work (since a couple of months I prefer doing manual rather than autofocus). Then I add tags and import my GPS tacklog data from my [Suunto Ambit3 Sport](http://amzn.to/1zjn7cR) into Lightroom. Lightroom uses this data to apply reverse geocoding on my pictures, which means that it translates GPS data into a readable address.

Finally, I save the new metadata and Lightroom adds the data to an XMP sidecar file on each picture. During the export process in Lightroom I also attach a watermark on my pictures which I then upload to flickr (not all of them). Now I am ready to use my new pictures on my blog projects. To be on the safe side, I also backup my data via Time Machine on a second [WD Passport](http://amzn.to/1FxfPTy) hard drive.

## Conclusion
There are several ways to transfer your files and work with them. The process described above is just my personal preference. Lightroom works perfectly fine on a Macbook Air as long as you store the Lightroom Catalogue and the smart preview files on a SSD drive in case you have a huge Lightroom Catalogue as I have.
