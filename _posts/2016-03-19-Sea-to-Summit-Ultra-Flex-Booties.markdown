For our packrafting trips we are more or less always wearing our dry suites which we combine with latex socks. As you probably can imagine just wearing latex socks would be quite chilly to paddle with especially during the colder months. So how do we keep our feet warm? It's all about layering and the Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booties as an outer shell might help as well. The booties are probably also a good choice for those who are into Kayaking or Stand up paddling.

We usually combine the latex socks with several merino socks layers (2-3) under it. Moreover, a neoprene shoe like the Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booeties can also help to keep your feet warm the same way as divers are using neoprene suites to keep their body warm.

The Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booties also help to protect your feet when walking in the river. We also found them more packagble then our Teva Sandals which we used before. An advantage of the Teva Sandals is however, that they do not soak water like neoprene.

Another advantage of the Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booties is that they are also less pricey than the Teva Sandals. As the Sea to Summit booties do also completely enclose your feet you will probably have less chances to loose your shoes while walking in the river as velcro tape alone may not be a safe choice to keep your sandals or shoes attached especially if velcro gets dirty.

We will continue testing the Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booties this year to see if they are also durable. To be continued ...
