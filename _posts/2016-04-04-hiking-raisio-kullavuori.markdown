Last weekend I went with <a href="http://caide.kuvat.fi/">Caj</a> to Raisio to visit the Kullavuori watch tower which is a short hike (around 2.5 km in one direction) from the nearby ABC Raisio gas station where we parked our cars. 

The Kullavuori watch tower is approximately 71 m above sea level which is quite high compared to the rather flat area of the region. There are plenty of pine trees along the trail so it's quite easy to find wood for a camp fire. There is also a pet cemetary when you enter the trail in Raisio.

Even so the temperatures reached about 9C on that day there was still ice on the trail.

A lean-to shelter or 'Laavu' in Finnish is very common to find in Finnish National Parks.

The trail was quite good marked and we came across several waypoints.

## Conclusion
Turku is a nice place to start exploring the Archipelago but there are also nice places nearby to explore on land like the Kullavuori or the [Kurjenrahka National Park](http://www.hikeventures.com/autumn-colors-around-lake-savojarvi/). There is also a trail which you can hike from Kullavuori to the Kurjenrahka National Park.
