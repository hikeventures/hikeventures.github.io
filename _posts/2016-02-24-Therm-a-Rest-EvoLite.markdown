Last year we have tested the Therm-a-Rest EvoLite on our hiking and packrafting trips in Japan and Sweden and here is a review about this self-inflating sleeping pad.

## EvoLite Specifications
The EvoLite sleeping pad is part of Therm-a-rest’s Fast & Light product line. The EvoLite (regular) weights 520 grams, is 51 cm wide and 183 cm long and 5 cm thick. However, we tested the larger version (196 cm) or the EvoLite. The bottom of the EvoLite is made of 30d mini Rip Polyester. The innovation in this mattress is that it is self-inflating which means that you just have to blow into the valve a couple of times and the EvoLite is ready for the night.

## EvoLite Field Testing
We have tested the EvoLite in Japan and Sweden. On the picture below you can see the EvoLite on top of our MSR Hubba NX tent in Japan.

The best way to set up your camp is to get the EvoLite pat out of the stuff bag and then focus on other things (e.g. preparing a meal or pitching the tent) while the EvoLite inflates and add the missing air via the valve into the sleeping pad after a couple of minutes. 

We have used the EvoLite indoors and outdoors in Japan.

Especially in warmer conditions the EvoLite was a great choice for us. Below Marta on the EvoLite in Japan.

While Marta enjoyed the EvoLite in Japan, Patrick got his hands on the EvoLite in northern Sweden. Made for the summer, the EvoLite is probably not that suitable for the summer in northern Scandinavia. The night temperatures went quite low and Patrick felt during the night that the EvoLite was not sufficient for the summer in northern Sweden.

However, Patrick enjoyed the self-inflating capability of the EvoLite especially after a long paddling day where you don’t want to spend more time than needed to inflate a sleeping pad.

## Conclusion
For those who don’t like to inflate sleeping pads, a self-inflating sleeping pad like the EvoLite might be a great solution depending where you are planning to use it. For warmer regions the EvoLite is probably a great choice. If you are planning to travel to colder places I would rather take the Therm-a-Rest XTherm with me. The XTherm is somewhat lighter than the EvoLite and keeps you warm till deep into minus temperatures. The only downside of the XTherm is however that it is not a self-inflating sleeping pad. However, it can be used in   a bigger temperature range.
