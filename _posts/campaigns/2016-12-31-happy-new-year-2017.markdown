We wish you a happy new year 2017. 2016 has been a very busy year. We went hiking and packrafting in Russia, Sweden, Scotland, Finland, Norway, Austria, Poland, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Then we have also visited the ISPO in Munich.

2017 will be quite busy again. In January we are going winter camping in Northern Norway. Then we will be most likely on a few packrafting meetings in Scotland and Sweden. We have a few more plans which we won't reveal yet. So check our blog from time to time in 2017 :)

Happy New Year!
