Having a good tool on the trail is almost as essential as having a backpack. However, such a tool should be lightweight, multi-functional and durable. And that's where the <a href="http://www.victorinox.com" target="_blank">Victorinox</a> Cadet 5 Colors comes in - a high quality Swiss engineered tool with 8 functions, a high-quality unvarnished cow-hide wallet and a good grip in your hands.
