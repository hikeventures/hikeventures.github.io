As we are frequently on packrafting trips we are of course always looking for new packrafting gear like a PFD (personal floating device). Here comes our selection of the best PFD's for 2016.

# How to choose the best PFD?
The best PFD for your next packrafting adventure depends on where you are planning to packraft. Are you planning to packraft in a strong rapid then you probably need more capable PFD  than packrafting on a calm lake. Also when you plan to packraft in the open sea you should look for a PFD which can also handle stormy sea conditions as the weather can also change quickly on the sea. Of course, you should always check the weather conditions before you go packrafting on the sea. Packrafts are actually not meant to be used on the sea but we have also paddled on the baltic sea in Finland and it worked quite well with our windpaddle sail. However, we made sure that there was a ferry connection on the way back as it would have been quite hard to paddle the whole way back.

PFD's are categorized by pfdma.org ([http://www.pfdma.org/choosing/types.aspx)](http://www.pfdma.org/choosing/types.aspx)into different classes (USCG and State Law Enforcement agencies require and/or recommend different Types of lifejackets for different applications) and I would recommend to read through the pfdma.org pages to make sure that you select the right one if you live in the U.S.

For our paddling (we are paddling with a dry suite and usually class 2 and sometimes class 3 rapids, we would choose the following life jackets:

The Astral Design V-Eight is a PFD for the summer. It's mesh lets the air flow straight to your body. It's slso s great life jacket since the back part of the PFD is positioned higher than on a regular PFD.

## Inflatable Pfd


Most adults need an extra 7 to 12 pounds of buoyancy to keep their head above water. Below is a list of minimum buoyancy for each type of lifejacket.

Type I22 lbs.
Type II15.5 lbs.
Type III15.5 lbs.
Ring Buoy16.5 lbs.
Boat Cushion18 lbs.
Hybrid inflatable22/7.5 lbs.
Special use device15.5 to 22 lbs.
Offshore Lifejacket (Type 1)

This lifejacket is designed for extended survival in rough, open water. It usually will turn an unconscious person face up and has over 22 pounds of buoyancy. This is the best lifejacket to keep you afloat in remote regions where rescue may be slow in coming.

Near Shore Buoyant Vest (Type II)

This "classic" lifejacket comes in several sizes for adults and children and is for calm inland water where there is chance of fast rescue. It is less bulky and less expensive than a Type I, and many will turn an unconscious person face-up in the water.

Flotation Aid (Type III)

These lifejackets are generally considered the most comfortable, with styles for different boating activities and sports. They are for use in calm water where there is good chance of fast rescue since they will generally not turn an unconscious person face-up. Flotation aids come in many sizes and styles.

Throwable Device (Type IV)

These are designed to be thrown to a person in the water. Throwable devices include boat cushions, ring buoys, and horseshoe buoys. They are not designed to be worn and must be supplemented by wearable lifejacket. It is important to keep these devices immediately available for emergencies, and they should not be used for small children, non-swimmers, or unconscious people.

Special Use Device (Type V)

Special use lifejackets include work vests, deck suits, and hybrids for restricted use. Hybrid vests contain some internal buoyancy and are inflatable to provide additional flotation.

Inflatable LifeJackets

Inflatable lifejackets rely on inflatable chambers that provide buoyancy when inflated. Uninflated, inflatable life jackets are less bulky than inherently buoyant life jackets. Inflatables come in a variety of U.S. Coast Guard-defined performance types. The specific type of life jacket is determined by characteristics such as its amount of buoyancy, its in-water performance and its type of inflation mechanism. To understand the details of a life jacket, read the life jacket label and owners manual, and consult your dealer or retailer if necessary.

All inflatables contain a backup oral inflation tube (which also serves as the deflation tube).
