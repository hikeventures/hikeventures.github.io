Hiking the Trail was started several years ago to chronicle my
Appalachian Trail thru hike in spring of 2013.

After having to come off the AT the blog has morphed into a resource for hikers as well as a place for me to share my adventures.

<h3>My Basecamp</h3>

When I started <a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.hikingthetrail.com/" target="_blank">HikingTheTrail.com</a> I was living in Kansas City and have
since moved to southern Arizona.

<h3>My History</h3>

I grew up in the outdoors in the Boy Scouts of America. I achieved the
highest rank of Eagle and continued to active outdoors. I attended
university where I completed a degree in web design and development. I
worked in the web design field for nearly 10 years before becoming
burnt out and needed a hobby so I focused on hiking and backpacking
again.  Now I am using my web design and development talents in the
outdoor industry.

<h3>The outdoor community of Social Media blogging.</h3>

Over the several years of running my social media accounts and blogs I
have met both virtually and in real life hundreds of amazing people. A
huge change from the dog eat dog world of social media and design
“gurus” I had become accustom too.  I have been very fortunate to have
been given several opportunities to take my blogging and social media
skills to the next level. One of those is being selected as a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hikingthetrail.com/2013/04/omniten-epic-adventures-powered-by-awesome-gear/" target="_blank">Columbia
Sportswear #omniten blogger</a>.

Having met all of these awesome people and being able to experience
some awesome opportunities I have been able to push myself personally,
professionally, and  physically by  truly amazing people.

I want to thank you for allowing me to tell my story on your blog and
wish that everyone gets out into the outdoors as often as they can and
enjoy what is out there.

Happy Trails.

Adam
