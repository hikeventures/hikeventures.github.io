We are a group of avid hikers who enjoy spending time in the magnificent forests and parks of the mid-Atlantic states. Over the years, we have hiked many beautiful mountains and valleys, and founded <a href="http://www.hikingupward.com" target="_blank">www.HikingUpward.com</a> to share what weâ€™ve learned, create a meeting place for people who like to hike, and encourage anyone with an interest to enjoy the outdoors.<br><br>

Since starting HikingUpward in 2000, we have constantly worked to create the best hiking resource in the region. Many of our new features reflect suggestions from hikers who use our site. Some of those features include using our interactive map to search for a hike by any or all of our 5 hike categories: Difficulty, Solitude, Streams/Falls, Camping and Views. Each of our hikes contain downloadable PDF Maps, elevation profiles, photos, weather links, Google directions to the trailhead, mile by mile trail narrative, etc. Just by visiting our website, you have become a member of the HU community, and we invite you to post a review and share your tales from the trail. All of this information is provided for our hiking community to help them decide if a particular hike is worth attempting based on their particular hiking skills and fitness levels.

The majority of our 230 plus hikes are in Virginia where we live and range from just a few miles in length to multi-day backpack trips of over 41 miles. Some our more popular hikes include Old Rag Mountain with some cool rock scrambling near the summit, Crabtree Falls with multiple cascades, Grayson Highlands with wild horses roaming the balds, Big Schloss with castle like rock formations, McAfee Knob - with an overlook that is one of the most photographed spots on the Appalachian Trail and Three Ridges - a tough 2 day backpack with challenging climbs.<br><br>
