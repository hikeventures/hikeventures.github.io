My blog is about mountaineering, backpacking, and hiking, mostly in the United States, but in some international locations as well.

## Why did you start blogging?
I wanted to share my knowledge about the best natural spots located in the United States. 

## What are the three biggest benefits to your target audience and why?
Hmmm, a tough question. I’d have to say that the three biggest benefits are that they get good details about each location from an experienced outdoors person with a funny personality. 

## What are the 3 top questions asked by your readers? Top three questions? 
1) How do I get there?
2) When do I go there? 
3) What do I take when I go there?

## What tips can you recommend that you’d only share with a close friend (and everyone reading your blog)? 
If you’re visiting a National Park, go in the off-season – spring, fall, winter – but not summer. You’ll see more wildlife, less people, and more natural beauty. 

Thank you for your time!
