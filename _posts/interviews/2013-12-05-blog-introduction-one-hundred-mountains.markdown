If you open a hiking map to any of Japan's mountain ranges, you'll see a few peaks marked as "Nihon Hyakumeizan" - members of the One Hundred Mountains of Japan. These mountains are the personal choice of a writer called Fukada Kyuya, who published a best-selling book about them in 1964.<br><br>

This blog is about those One Hundred Mountains, and the people who climb them. The starting point for most of the posts is Fukada's book ("Nihon Hyakumeizan") but, as you'll see, this blog is somewhat hobbyhorsical. That is to say, the blogger, who styles himself Project Hyakumeizan, feels free to gallop off in any direction that interests him.<br><br>

So here you'll find posts about climbing, ski-touring, hiking, sawa-nobori - that is the Japanese art of river-climbing, not to be confused with canyoning - mountain science, cultural history, and even politics.<br><br>

Incidentally, if you want to find out how Project Hyakumeizan and his friends got started on climbing in the Japanese Alps, you'll find the <a href="http://onehundredmountains.blogspot.ch/2009/06/beating-about-buttress.html" target="_blank">story in Special moments on Kita-dake Buttress.<br><br>

And, yes, sorry, quite a few of the posts are much too long. But that's what happens when you let your hobbyhorse gallop out of control. Even so, <a href="http://onehundredmountains.blogspot.fi" target="_blank">Project Hyakumeizan</a> hopes you will enjoy reading and he will always value your comments and feedback.
