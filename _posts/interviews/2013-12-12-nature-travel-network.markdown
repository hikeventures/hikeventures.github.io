Travellers share the same wanderlust, but we travel for different reasons. Many of us travel to experience nature, for instance.

But there are at least three types of nature travellers: adventure sportsmen, passive admirers, and what I call the “biologically curious.” The <a href="http://www.naturetravelnetwork.com">Nature Travel Network (NTN) blog</a> appeals to all three, but we are especially suited to the biologically curious. We write for travellers who want to explore a landscape so deeply that they emerge intellectually and spiritually informed, not only about its structure and function, but about ourselves. This makes us feel good; it deepens our connection to the earth in a way nothing else can.

It’s not enough, for instance, to traipse through remote and ecologically unique landscapes in simple admiration, we want to throw ourselves down on the ground and writhe like pigs in the cakey mud until every inch of us is replete with its must and wildness. 

The closest we can come to doing this is by understanding the habitats, plants, and animals that live there. A tree is not just a tree; it is a pin oak, sugar maple, or quaking aspen; and it just doesn’t stand there, it provides shade to ground dwellers; structure to insects, molds, and fungi; and provides protection to cavity-nesting birds. But which ones? Well, let’s look up (or kneel down) and see. None of us can or want to name everything but we pick our specialties—botany, birds, mushrooms, butterflies, dragonflies, whatever. Like any precious metal, the rarer it is, the more special the find.

Birds. We write about them a lot. Mostly because they are everywhere and move a lot, so they are easy to find. But also because I am nuts about them and am attracted to like minds. Birds are beautiful creatures that show a remarkable diversity in shape, size, and brilliant colorations. Take my word for it. What seems like a kooky hobby actually thrilling once you see what’s out there. 

I started Nature Travel Network to inform and inspire this kind of travel by providing practical information on where to go and what amazing wildlife you’ll see when you get there. We aim to offer an “inside-track” to the biologically curious – revealing the special somethings you may discover at a site in the hopes you don’t miss a single one. We also provide general overviews that will appeal to anyone who enjoys nature of any kind, at any distance.

The site also connects travellers with <a href="http://www.naturetravelnetwork.com/meet-the-guides/">experienced nature guides</a> who help interpret the landscape and make your travel more meaningful. Field guides are like wizards of the natural world. They see things that most of us cannot see.  

And though we are a young blog (launched April 2013) with meager resources, we manage to put out a few compelling travel posts every week. Stop by sometime and see what we’re all about. Follow us on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/naturetravelnet">Facebook</a> and drop me a note if you want to chat. 

Meanwhile, many thanks to Patrick and Konstantin for allowing me to wax on about nature travel. Hope to see you in a wild place someday!
