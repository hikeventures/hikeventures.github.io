# Conclusion
Personally, I like the [Therm-a-Rest XTherm](http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-sleeping-pad) the most and I use it during summer and winter time. Even so it is not the newest sleeping pad on the market, it provides high insulation and comes with low weight. I always carry it on our [hiking and packrafting trips](http://www.hikeventures.com/destinations/).
