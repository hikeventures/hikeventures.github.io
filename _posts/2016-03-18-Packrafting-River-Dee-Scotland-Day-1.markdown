description: Our February packrafting adventure in Scotland.
---
In January we made plans to go packrafting in the Scottish Highlands and decided to raft down the River Dee for a couple of days. Knowing that the temperatures were below 0 C degree during the night we were quite lucky with the weather as we had sunshine until the last day.

## Meeting at the airport
We met at the airport - Konstantin arrived just 1 hour later than Patrick - and we took the new tram from the airport to the city center. Once we arrived in the city center we were searching for Konstantin's hotel where he was planning to stay for another week after our planned packrafting trip. We unloaded some of our clothes from our backpack in the hotel and started walking through the city towards the central station.

## With the train from Edinburgh to Aberdeen
At 16.28 we left Edinburgh  Waverly with the Scotrail train to Aberdeen. The train was packed and the train conductor apologiesed several times for this on the loudspeaker. Fortunately, we had both made a seat reservation. A woman behind us booked a forward seat but got a small one on which she had to travel sideways. She swapped it with another person, who was not able to find her reserved seat and was happy with the one she got. 

## The Scottish Scenery
The scenery outdoor is great. We go over the bridge, just got listed by the unesco, and pass by to the othe side of the Forth. People step off and step on the train, but the further we go, the few people there are. We pass by places with difficult English names and completely unpronounceable Scottish. In the hotel last nigh in Aberdern saw BBC Alba - Gaelic language course - teaching how to say 13 ponds - douh. Repeated at least 20 times. Finally, we go over an impressive railway bridge in Dundee (is it the same name as in Australia, Patrick asks) and arrive in Aberdeen after dark.

## With the bus to Braemar
The next morning we packed our backpacks and had a typical English breakfast in our hotel before we went to the bus station to catch the train to Braemar.

## Arrival in Braemar
The second of the three great rivers of Scotland. Next year the third?
We were more than lucky with the weather. It was cold, but windless and very sunny.
When we arrived, we tried to step out where everyone did. And the bus driver asked us if we wanted to get out a bit further. How far? Just over that building. No thank you. Patrick went to buy done water and a toothbrush and then went back to the outdoor shop that we saw on the way. He had to get another pair of socks.

## Enjoying a cup of tea in Braemar
While I was left with the luggage in the sun. The sun was marvellous. It's golden rays were  poring over me warming my whole body to the core. At the same time there were patches of snow lying around and the air gave that crispy smell that only winter has. How cold was it? I was not sure. On the opposite side from the bus stop I saw a tea room and I decided to move out things there. A middle aged man was sweeping the street next to it. So Patrick ran for his socks and I carried our bags to the hall and entered the place.
The place looked cosy. There were not a lot of people there, just a couple that travelled with us from Aberdeen on the same bus. They didn't have a lot of luggage with them, but it seemed that they came to Breamar for a romantic getaway.

When I entered, I was approached by a middle aged woman wearing a neat white apron, who asked me where I would like to sit. I chose the corner table with a bit of s view and in the sun coming through the window. The other sunny spot was already occupied by the couple. When I say down, the woman brought me the menu, which I didn't really need as I knew exactly what I wanted - a pot of tea.
Talking about about the concept of the pot of tea - I hardly ever saw anything like that on a menu anywhere else outside Britain. And as a tea drinker, I think it is a shame that people don't do it more often as the British got it right - one small cup of tea, the one that you usually get in the Netherlands or in other parts on the continental Europe, just won't do it. You cannot just have one. You need more. And a pot of tea is a perfect solution for it.

Having ordered my pot of tea, I had a chance to look around. Besides the woman who severed me, there was another elderly woman, wearing a similar neat white apron. She was busy doing something behind a glass display which contained a five selection of most deliciously looking muffins and pastry. Looking at them I wished I still ate sugar. But I had to stay strong and I chased the tempting thoughts away. My pot of tea arrived and standing.

## On the way to the River Dee
Refreshed we started walking to find a place where we could inflate our packrafts and finally start our packrafting trip. It has been very cold during the night and the gras was still frozen. However, the wonderful scenery and sun made us feel excited to start paddling and to get close to the nature.
    
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25607400980/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/25607400980_4a2ed0c9df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    
After a short hike we found a spot which was suiteable to inflate our packrafts and to easily get into the river. On some spots the river was partly frozen but as we realized later on it was not difficult to break with our packrafts through the ice.
    
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25813026991/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1540/25813026991_f2dc51fe86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
## Inflating the Packrafts
Having in inflated our packrafts we were good to go. Konstantin inflated his packraft on a different spot but Patrick was the first one who made it into the river. 
    
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25720737682/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1499/25720737682_7e90c9e959_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
The mountains were still covered with snow. We actually had a discussion if we should go on a hiking trip before packrafting down the river Dee but decided to start paddling immediately as the weather forecast only promised good weather for the coming 2-3 days.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25815608426/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1507/25815608426_e63297c5c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
Already at the beginning we realized that the water level of the Dee was quite low. Nevertheless, it was still possible to paddle.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25211155704/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1543/25211155704_7246941e5b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
An advantage of a river with a low water level is that there are plenty of opportunities to get our of the packraft to have a break. We had our first brake already after 30 minutes or so.
      
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540976580/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1678/25540976580_95957933d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
Sometimes ice can create an interesting motive for pictures.

## Deer fencing
After some paddling we came across the first obstacle which we have read about already in several other blogs and websites -  the deer fence. However, the fence was in such a bad shape that it was quite easy to paddle under the steel rope on the left side of the river.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25720731532/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1702/25720731532_b15b7974c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
After the fence it was quite easy to paddle along the river and there were no major obstacles or rapids until we reached the first major rapid at the Invercauld bridge.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25746562021/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1670/25746562021_69799f21d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## The Invercauld bridge 
The invercauld bridge was built in 1859 and we were looking for a spot where we could step out of our packrafts so that we could go and scout the rapid which flows just under the bridge. Again the low water level didn't offer many opportunities to pass our first major obstacle as we realized on our scout. 
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25841666865/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1624/25841666865_141d7f355a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
Our first scout put Konstantins new <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Sea-to-Summit-Ultra-Flex-Booties/">Sea to Summit Ultra Flex Booties</a> into test.
      
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25215076843/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1525/25215076843_72b6fa4c0b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      
The Invercauld bridges were actually quite interesting and built in Victorian architecture style.
      
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540972010/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1596/25540972010_8f7df53c2d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
We were walking along a small path next to the river to find out if it was possible to paddle the rapid.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540971350/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1514/25540971350_3513fb43df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      
Not only the River Dee makes it interesting to paddle there ...
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25540970700/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1687/25540970700_3df0722898_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
... but also the rich historical culture and buildings on the way.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25746558441/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1481/25746558441_7f3751e22b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
We went on and under the Invercauld bridge.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25211168844/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1577/25211168844_97c62028f0_o.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
I guess this picture shows already that it was still quite cold to paddle.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25841663315/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1653/25841663315_8d3a19524b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
As you can see on the picture the water level was quite low and it was hard to find the right spot to pass this rapid. There were many stones where you could get stuck with your packraft and flip over. Patrick decided to carry the packpack around and to take pictures of Konstantin paddling through the rapid. 
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25215076133/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1595/25215076133_a6ef1fd5c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Packrafting the River Dee in Scotland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
Konstantin on a small rapid after the main rapid under the Invercauld bridge.

Looking backwards from our packrafts the Invercauld bridge was quite an experience.

## Cambus O' May suspension bridge
The suspension bridge at Cambus O' May was built in 1905 and rebuilt in 1988 for safety reasons and one of the most popular destinations for tourists visiting Victorian sites in this area.

## Problems with the Packraft
Konstantin's had some issues with his Alpacka Packraft during our trip. Air went out through the zippers and there was a puncture at the bottom of his packraft which he managed to temporarily quick fix it.
     
<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/25607416640/in/dateposted-public/" title="Packrafting the River Dee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1576/25607416640_4cca5435b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting the River Dee"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
     
After our trip Konstantin contacted Alpacka Raft and reported the issue on his packraft. Alpacka agreed to fix both issues on his packraft and also paid for the shipping fees. We would say that this is quite good customer service from Alpacka Raft.
