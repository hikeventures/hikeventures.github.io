A portable and lightweight camping stove is one of the most essential item to have on your adventures to boil water for tea, coffee or dehydrated meals. Here comes our buying guide with the best lightweight camping stoves in 2016 for your next hiking, backpacking, packrafting, mountaineering or any other backcountry trip. The stoves are sorted according to their weight and we have picked them according to our own preferences. Also it's a good idea to have a [Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel](http://amzn.to/22kZs72) with you. Sometimes matches can get wet but with the Swedish FireSteel you don't have to worry about that. Just make sure that you know how to use the FireSteel before you set out to the backcountry.

The MSR MicroRocket is the lightest stove in our list. If saving weight has your highest priority and you want to use a gas stove then you should go for the MSR MicroRocket.

### MSR WindPro II

**Weight:** 187 grams

The MSR WindPro II is a nice stove for those who want to have the burner separated which gives more stability but also the possibility to keep the gas canister warm in colder temperatures.

### MSR WindBoiler 

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NPPWOJ2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00NPPWOJ2&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=G7LF7ACULXJOSCLX"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPPWOJ2&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00NPPWOJ2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 432 grams   
**Burn Time:** 2.5 (0.5 Liter)   
**Fuel:** Gas   

The MSR WindBoiler is the latest addition on the stove market from MSR. This stove is marketed to operate very well under windy conditions. The MSR Windboiler is currently our favourite stove on our trips (for 2 person) even so it weights a little bit more than the other stoves. If you are traveling alone then the Jetboil MiniMo (see below) might be a good alternative.

### MSR XGK EX

<a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUMKFO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000EUMKFO&linkCode=as2&tag=hikeve-20&linkId=VXEWELGDXLVW6BJU"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B000EUMKFO&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=hikeve-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hikeve-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000EUMKFO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Weight:** 489 grams (packed)   
**Burn Time:** 2.8 (1 Liter) with kerosene fuel   
**Fuel:** Multiple   

The MSR XGK EX is probably the best choice if you need a stove which can handle multiple fuels in extreme conditions.

## How to choose the best camping stove?
It all depends on your requirements. Do you need a simple and lightweight camping stove then the MSR MicroRocket would be a good choice. Do you plan a trip to colder regions or areas where you have to use different fuels? Then a camping stove with a separated gas canister (so you can keep the gas canister warm) like the MSR Dragonfly should be on your choice. 

My preference in most cases goes towards a camping stove which boils water quickly and uses a low amount of fuel as I am usually traveling with dehydrated food packages where I just have to add boiling water e.g. the MSR Winboiler or the Jetboil Flash. If you are traveling to different continents then a multi-fuel stove might be the best solution.
