The island of Örö is located in the outer archipelago and is one of the last big islands before the open sea. Örö offers a lot of cultural history (military) and a diverse landscape. It's also a great place for hiking since the trails are well marked on the trail and on the map. The blue trail going south-west and the red trail going north-north-east. Örö also offers good trail blazing and a lot of interpration panels in 3 languages (Swedish, Finnish and English). If you are into diving then you may need a special permission to do it on Örö. However, it's quite easy to find out what's allowed and what is not as this information is provided at several places. The ferry from Kasnäs to Örö costs 16 EUR one way or 25 EUR if you buy a return ticket. Bicycles can also be taken on the ferry.

In the [Archipelago Nature Centre Blue Mussel](http://www.nationalparks.fi/archipelagonaturecentre/visit) we received plenty of information and very good service from its staff. In the nature center you can learn a lot about the flora and fauna in the Finnish Archipelago. Unfortunately, the information boards are all in Finnish and Swedish but there was also a booklet in English available, which guided us through the nature center.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27583026502/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7591/27583026502_5ea0f0e956_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island Archipelago Nature Centre Blue Mussel Blåmusslan Kasnäs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From the tower we enjoyed a great view over the area. It's possible to have a break in the tower. There are benches and nature books available which you can read.

## Packrafting from Kasnäs to Örö

In Kasnäs we loaded off our gear while Patrick parked the car approximately 500 meters away from the harbor (it was free to park there), Konstantin started preparing his packraft. [Here](http://www.movescount.com/moves/move109498126) you can find the GPS data from our packrafting trip.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27583029302/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7363/27583029302_a78bf8013e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="719" alt="Örö Island Finland Kasnäs harbor alpacka raft packrafting hmg porter 4400"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On our way from Kasnnäs to Örö we came across a few sailing ships.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27073203263/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7784/27073203263_5a2191ec36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island sailing windpaddle alpacka raft boat hmg porter 4400"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Patrick's [Suunto Traverse](http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-traverse-gps-watch) helped us to find the Örö island. We also used a small map of the area that we got in the information centre as well as a map in Gaia GPS app that Konstantin downloaded at the harbour, where there was free Wi-Fi.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27583029082/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7391/27583029082_9b80fd7cda_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island Finland Suunto Traverse"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The weather was just fantastic and we would strongly recommend to take sun lotion with you if you plan a similar trip in the Finnish Archipelago.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27405233870/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7507/27405233870_9ef481799b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Örö Island Finland 2016"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The sea became a bit more rough after these islands but we still enjoyed our trip.

A light house and seagulls - that's the Finnish Archipelago.

## Arriving at the main harbor of Örö

After 15 km of windpaddle sailing with our packrafts we finally arrived on Örö. It took us just over three hours to cover that distance. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27583029502/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7099/27583029502_a99f8edf08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="527" alt="Örö Island Finland 2016"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We were really lucky that almost for the whole trip the wind was blowing in the right general direction of the island, otherwise it would have been a lot of paddling. Or, in case of southerly winds, we would not have been able to use our packrafts on the way to the island at all. Instead we could have taken a boat to the island and paddle on the way back, which is exactly the oposite of what we did this time.  

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27073203223/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7418/27073203223_5b7ce42381_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island Finland harbor packraft hmg porter julbo swell alpacka raft werner shuna windpaddle sail"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Before going to the camping site, which is accessible from a small bay on the south of the island, we decided to pretend that we were 'big boats' and entered the harbour instead, where we had a quick look around. There were two small buildings there, one of which was a small coffee house. While the offer was limited, their staff were very friendly and their prices were quite reasonable. For example, a piece of cake would cost you 2 Euro, which is no different from anywhere else. While it had a few sitting places inside (which could come in handy in case of bad weather, we presume), there was a large number of tables and benches outside. Somewhat further, there was a fireplace and a grill (which turned out to be the only place on the island where you can have an open fire). Please note, that you need to bring your own coals or wood if you want to use it (or, try to rely on the kindness of boaters, like we did the first evening when we came there to grill our sausages).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27683697455/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Ö"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7239/27683697455_36fe4e3e1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö harbor coffee house finland island fortress"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After a short stop at the harbour, we decided to paddle to the take-out place on the south of the island.  Swans were also quite common in Örö.

## Facilities on Örö

Örö offers quite nice facilities for it's visitors like a Sauna with direct access to the sea. There are also Hotels, cottages and appratments available for rent. If you plan to go eating in the restaurant then you should probably make a reservation because they have limited capacity of cooking but lots of seating space. The prices in the restaurant are quite common as in other finnish restaurants. The restaurant also had a vegetarian dish as a main course on offer. One course was available with lamb from the island. There is no grocery store on the island so it's advisable to do your shopping before you enter the island.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27683697595/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Ö"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7185/27683697595_bc071242f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sauna Örö Island Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Toilets could be found all over the island and they were pretty good and each of them were equiped with toilet paper.

## How to get on Örö island with your packraft of kayak?

It is not allowed to enter Örö island on any other spot than the harbor or the dedicated landing spot for kayakers below where Konstantin is posing for the picture.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27073202953/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7515/27073202953_9823352a88_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island kayaking packrafting reach enter land harbor"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Camping on Örö

Camping on Örö is possible on the tent site nearby the landing point for kayakers. At the camping site we met 3 women. One of them came already last year and brought her friends this year to show them them island. They stayed for 2 nights. Also it was safe to keep the lugagge in the tent while we explored the island.

Once we walked a few meters from the landing spot for kayaks into the forest we saw a sign which pointed to the tent site where we pitched our tent.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27609266451/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7567/27609266451_faa2a20009_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island Finland tent site sign directional hiking kayaking"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next to the tent site there was a shelter where you could have lunch when it's raining. Unfortunately, there was no fire place and it's also not possible to make an open camp fire on the island. However, there is a fire place nearby the main harbor in Örö where you can make a fire. It's probably a good idea to take a gas stove with you just to be on the safe side.

## Exploring the Örö Island and the Fortress

Patrick standing next to a shell with a weight of 500 kg. They were used with the larger canons which can reach targets with a distance up to 45 km from the island.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27683697435/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö island shell"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7728/27683697435_1195e36da8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö island shell canon"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is the 305 mm Obukhovskii gun where the shells have been used. This is the biggest canon on the island and also defended the Bengtskär lighthouse during the Continuation war against Russia.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27609266871/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7530/27609266871_558b046ea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island Finland 305 mm Obukhovskii gun continuation war"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A replacement canon which weights 50 tons and has been manufactured in St. Petersburg.

There are also a couple of danger signs on the island.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27683697745/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Danger signs on Örö"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7589/27683697745_f44b7b9f7c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Danger signs on Örö island Finland"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Trenches could be also found all over the island. This one was built to protect an open area from enemies which could land here for example with a helicopter. Cable fences have been placed around areas which might cause a danger. The sense of history is very present on Örö. You can still find military places left how they were e.g. beds in the bunkers.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27609266051/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland 2016"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7394/27609266051_8bf1ea0d84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Örö Island Finland trenches fortification"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One of the biggest treat on the island was probably the poisenous snakes (Pyhton) so it's always good to pay special attention toweards snakes while hiking on the island. Talking about wild life, there are also some seals in the neighborhood and a guy was cleaning perches.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27073203023/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Örö Island Finland python snake"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7553/27073203023_ffea6fc338_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Örö Island Finland pyton snake"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The vegetation on Örö was quite colorful.

The trails were very well marked and also indicated the distance to the next sight.

This was another great spot at the south coast. We didn't feel at all that we were in a nordic country -  the sun, sea and the smell of the pine trees made you more think of destinations on the mediterranean sea.

These rocks are so typical for the Finnish Archipelago which have been formed by the last ice age.

On the south coast there were also able to find canon towers with an amazing view towards the Finnish Archipelago.

The Bengtskär Light House 14 km away from Örö. Unfortunately, we had only digital zoom on our camera that's why the image quality is not the best. :)

Patrick walking on the cobbled road which has been built to transport the heavy artillery and other material around the island. There are six kilometers of cobbled roads on the island which have been built in the 1910s. There has also been a railway till the 1960s. The roads also have their nickname, Pitkä Ikävä (Long Misery) and Lyhyt Ikäva (Short Misery).

This was a shooting range probably for short range fire weapons like pistols.

If you have an interest in towers then you will find Örö to be a perfect place to visit. There is an antenna, lighthouse tower, radar tower but no lookout tower which is a bit of a pity. The beach nearby the radar tower was quite fascinating.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90204224@N07/27683698125/in/album-72157669691179556/" title="Ö"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7715/27683698125_5d7affc4ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="808" alt="Örö beach radar tower"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We also found plenty of signs to protect the vegetation so we just keep waling on the trails.

Entomological research - We were not supposed to touch those lamps as they contained poisonous gas. Entomology is the scientific study of insects.

Here you can see the rifle range. When you turn to the right on this spot then you can see the same distance to the building where soldiers were shooting from.

The island offers a lot of variety. Once you are on a beach and the next minute you find yourself in a forest. Large canons have been placed here in the 1910s. At this time there was no forest on this spot but a clear view towards the sea.

There are many viewing spots along the trail which are offering a great view towards the Finnish Archipelago. All of the marked viewpoints also offer new wooden stairs which are leading up to them like to this gun on the east coast of Örö.

We also saw sheeps which were probably the grasing animals indicated on the information boards. It also seems that sausages were made out of them as the local restaurant had them on offer on it's menu.

## From Örö back to Turku

On the way to Kasnäs and back there is the Lövö bridge which offers a fantastic scenery over the Archipelago.

After the trip Konstantin had to take his flight from the airport in Turku back to Amsterdam but is looking forward for a new adventure in Finland with Patrick who is living in Turku since 2 years (and 10 years in Finland).

## Conclusion
Our trip to Örö Island was probably one of the best summer trips we have done in Finland. This trip offered a fantastic combination of nature and history. The staff on the Örö island was young and very friendly. It's also a good idea to take a wind braker with you as it was always windy except in the forest and at the camp site. What's more? Örö is not far from Turku or Helsinki and there is also the costal route - a 100 kilometer long scenic cycling route which goes from Salo down to the island of Rosala.
