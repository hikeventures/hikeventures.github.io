A Solar Panel is especially useful if you plan long hiking trips as me and Konstantin did in [Sarek](http://hikeventures.com/hiking-and-packrafting-in-sarek-day-1/)  (Northern Sweden) last year. This year we are planning to participate in the [Fj채llr채ven Claissic](http://www.fjallraven.com/classic) - a 110 km hike - where a Solar Panel could be useful as well (you will read about our Fj채llr채ven Classic hike on our <a href="http://hikeventures.com/atom.xml" target="_blank">blog</a> in autumn 2015).
