description: The Anfibio Packsuite and Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016 preperations
---
Last Sunday, <a href=caide.kuvat.fi">Caj</a> and his wife joined me for a trip in the Finnish Archipelago Sea around Ruisalo in Turku as they wanted to test their new Anfibio Packsuit which they ordered from the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Clothing/Anfibio-Packsuit::378.html">Packrafting Store</a> in Germany. Caj was already a bit in panic if he would receive his drysuite on time as he was planning to take it to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/501436800038543/">Swedish Packrafting Round-Up 2016</a> which will take place next weekend.

Caj decided to take his GoPro Hero Session camera to film our paddling adventure around the Turku islands. I have paddled already <a href="http://www.hikeventures.com/Paddling-the-Archipelago-Sea/">last year</a> quite a lot in the Turku Archipelago during the seasons.

The South-West Coast of Finland is one of my favourite outdoor spots in Finland. The sea, pine trees, seagulls, rocks and the wind give this whole place a certain magic (as Caj would probably describe it).

We had plenty of fun watching Caj testing his new Anfibio Drysuite.
