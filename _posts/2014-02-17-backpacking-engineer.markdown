Hello, to all you awesome HikeVentures followers! Nice to meet you. I am Night Terror from Backpacking Engineer (<a href="http://www.backpackingengineer.com">www.backpackingengineer.com</a>).

Backpacking Engineer introduced itself to the world on March 23, 2013. It was the result of my geeky, engineering mindset and my strange desire to learn HTML and PHP coding languages one winter. My love for backpacking actually started several years earlier as an attempt to get fit while being able to say, “I walked all the way from Georgia to Maine on the Appalachian Trail.” The getting fit part never really happened (it took other forms of activity to do that), but backpacking became a way of life.

I may be the coding brains behind Backpacking Engineer, but my wife, trail partner, ride bride and graphic design extraordinaire Falling Angel is the creative soul behind the curtains. She is responsible for our site, I simply put her images into code. Not only is she awesome at the web design stuff, but she can bust out 20 or 30 mile days while backpacking. She joins me on every outdoor adventure from backpacking, trail running, kayaking or even just bird watching. What more can a guy ask for!

Together, we try to provide our followers with a wide variety of topics on our site. Probably the most unique aspect of Backpacking Engineer is the “An Engineer’s Guide” blogs. Looking to provide our readers with something other backpacking blogs do not provide, I decided to get a little technical, a little engineering-ish with regards to the backpacking gear we all have come to love and cherish. I think it paid off because we get lots of compliments on our unique take on gear and how it works.

Realizing that nerdy details are not everyone’s cup of tea, we tackle many other backpacking topics including gear reviews, trail recipes and tips and tricks of the trade. Some of this information is even included as video blogs. We also try to maintain a somewhat informal trail journal such that you can follow our journeys and maybe daydream about being out on the trail with us.

Amazing views are just one part of the journey</center><br>

Let’s face it; there are more things to life than just backpacking. Like trail running, extreme fitness, kayaking, books, movies and beer! Very often, we step away from the backpacking scene and strive to introduce our readers to new activities. If I can offer one piece of advice I would say, “Don’t be afraid to try new things.” Falling Angel and I have been blessed with so many life-long memories because of trying new things. I will admit that I am certainly guilty of not always practicing what I preach, but hopefully the wide range of activities presented on our site will help create new memories in your life.

Oh, and don’t forget to check out our non-blog related content where you can find some basic info on trails, gear selection, trip planning and outdoor education. 

We hope to see you on our site and on the trail. Thanks HikeVentures for allowing us to introduce ourselves on your awesome site!

Happy Trails!
