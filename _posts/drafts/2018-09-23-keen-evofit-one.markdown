For my packrafting trips I was looking for sandals which I could combine together with my dry suite and it's latex socks. I prefer having sandals, since they are very versatile and dry quickly. They also feel more comfortable to me to wear when they are wet than wearing a completely wet shoe and KEEN was so kind to send me a pair of their EVOFIT ONE sandals to test it on my next packrafting trip in Teijo National Park in Finland.

## The idea behind the sandals

The KEEN EVOFIT ONE incorporates a new technology developed by KEEN which the company describe as a evolution in form, fit and function. KEEN describes it as a second skin which moves and breathes with your foot.

## Technology
EVOFIT comes with a 4-way dynamic stretch that moves fluidly on your skin, protects and adapts based on the movement of your foot. The sandals are made to be used in and out of water, for jungle trails and river rocks - so it seems that they are could be a great solution for packrafting as well. Moreover, they are also protecting your toes.

## First thoughts
The sandals are very comfortable to wear and I am quite confident that they should also handle longer walking distances quite well.

<br>

The sandals are also reinforced around the ankle for increased security.

<br>

The sandals can also be tightened with a strap.

The contour arch on the sole supports your foot arch as well.

The rubber sole looks like it can handle challenging situations.
