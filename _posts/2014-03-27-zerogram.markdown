<a href="http://www.zerogram.co.kr" target="_blank">Zerogram</a>, a Korea’s innovative lighter backpacking gear manufacturer.  I had dreamed of outdoor business since sometime after I began to mountaineering but it was obscure until I was inspired to start zerogram while I was hiking through John Muir Thru-hike in California, and I resolved to manufacture both minimal and eco-friendly outdoor gear then. I have hiked the trekking of Patagonia, in January 2014. I got also strong inspiration.

## The features of our products
We design gear not by cost or price of fabric and other material but by weight. The most important consideration of our design concept is to manufacture the lightest gear in the extent of not destroying functions of it. For example, the most popular item of our products is a silicon coated 20D fabric minimalist tarp. It's only 10 oz weighed, but very strong against the wind.

Another example of our products, it's a light and warm sleeping bag. In particular, White Wolf SE 680 sleeping bag which has been proven by EN 13537 test and weighs only 1,160g is a surprisingly light winter sleeping bag supporting a cold resistance temperature of extreme -33 degrees Celsius (F -27), comfort -6 degrees Celsius (F 21).
